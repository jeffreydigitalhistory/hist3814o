E. E. BLAOKMAN.\nRoca , Neb.\nAGAINST KISSING.\nWith the kisses of lovers , whether\nwedded or uuwedded , this protest has\nnothing to do In such cases the process\nis usually performed in private and it is\na tete-a-tcic which should not be dis\nturbed ; moreover , it occurs by mutual\nconsent of the parties concerned , and\ntherefore it is not the business of out\nsiders to interfere.\nBut it is high time to begin a war\nagainst kisses bestowed solely at the will\nof the giver ; since it is a manifest viola\ntion of the sacreduess of individuality ,\nand the majority of those upon whom it\nis inflicted are unwilling victims. Babies\nsquirm and do their best to get away\nfrom the smothering caresses so lavishly\nbestowed upon them ; children have to\nbe coaxed or bribed to give the \"sweet\nkiss\" demanded by importunate visitors ;\nsensible women shrink from the undue\nfamiliarity , and abhor the heartless lip\nservice which \"society\" prescribes for\nthe meetings and partings of the fair\nsex. What does it all mean ? Why do\nmature matrons and elderly maids rush\ninto each other's arms whenever they\nmeet , knowing as they do how little true\nfriendship there is in this world and how\nthe truest is the most modest and the\nleast presuming ? Why do young girls\nnip and peck at each other's cheeks and\nlips , when they know that the mind of\neach is occupied in taking note of the\nother's dress and criticising her claims to\nbeauty from the standpoint of a rival ?\nThe society kiss was in full vogue in\nFrance before the French revolution ,\nand it was doubtless originally a phase\nof Parisian coquohy ; like many other\nIT.\nfashions which have gradually spread\nover the world , losing all their piquancy\nand retaining oul- their absurdity , in the\nprocess of transfer. Nowadays women\nkiss each other through their veils , and\nembrace when their hearts are full of\nenvy , hatred , malice and alluucharitable-\nnets. \"May I kiss you ? \" said one lady ,\nat separating from another , after a con\nversation of a few moments in a railway\nstation , previous to which casualtncouu-\nter neither know of the other's exist\nence. Another lady , in a room full of\ncompany , when passing a woman with\nwhom she was only very slightly ac\nquainted , stooped and kissed her cheek ,\nwithout permission or apology.\nThe evil appears to bo on the increase ,\nespeciallly among \"English-speaking\"\npeople , and it is fostered by the maudlin\ntone of the light literature of the period.\nAny one who examines the modern novel\nwith reference to the subject will be\nastonished at the amount of feminine\n\"gush\" displayed in this intrusive and\nimpertinent form.\nA recent popular story , published in\nEngland and considered worthy of re\nproduction iuuTanohuitz , \" recordsy/ ? < ) / -\ntwo lasses , not including one which a\ncertain character wished to give but did\nnot , and not counting many embraces\nwhich presumably ended in osculation.\nAnd almost all of these embraces were\nbetween women , women not connected by\nblood-relationship nor long intimacy ,\nnor special sympathy. This feature is\nnow in English literature , as the custom\nalso is comparatively now among\nEnglish-speaking people. Jane Austen's\nheroines did not kiss , nor receive kisses\nnot Emma , in her unwise intimacy\nwith Harriet Smith , not Catharine\nMoreland , in her girlish friendship with\nEleanor Tilnoy , not peerless Anne Elliott ,\nadmired and beloved by her own sex\nwherever she went. Our grandmothers ,\neven our mothers , did not greet their\ncronies with tender embraces. Kisses\nwere exchanged between friends and re\nlations only when a long separation was\nin prospect , and those of us who have\nreached or passed middle age can prob\nably recall the time when this ceremony\nbegan to take on the proportions of a\n\"fad. \" Let us hope that it is only an\nother of the \"Jin de siecle\" maladies\nwhich will disappear in the fresh life\nand hope of a new century.\nI remember when the kissing mania\nbegan to infect the boarding-school\nwhich I attended , and how the reverend\nprincipal , a shrewd maiden lady , used to\nput a stop to all such demonstration by\nthe withering sarcasm : \"It looks exactly\nas if you wished if were a man.1' This\nhealthy view of the nature and mission\nof a kiss is upheld by the old Gorman\nproverb : \"Kin knss ohnc Bart ist ein ei\nohnc Salz. \" \"A kiss without a beard is\nan egg without salt , \" and still more\nsuggestively in the exquisite verses of\nthe old English poet , Robert Horrick.\nThis form of the kissing cult finds its\nmost enthusiastic exponent at present in\nMarion Orawford whose recent historical\nnovel , \"In the Palace of the King , \"\nfairly gushes over with elaborate de\nscriptions of tender osculation. The\nauthor's latest invention in this direc\ntion is to make the kisser kiss the kissee\nso hard that \"it hurt her ; \" though pity\nfor the victim of that fond violence is\nlessened by the assurance in one instance\nthat \"it was good to be hurt , \" and in\nanother that the kisses \"would have\nhurt her , if she had not loved them so\nand given back every one. \" All of\nwhich sounds very flat to the gentle\nreader , who is called upon to listen and\nlook on. It makes one inclined to rebel\neven against the commands of Scripture\nin regard to the \"holy kiss\" and the\n\"kiss of charity , \" and to feel respectful\nadmiration for certain tribes and peoples\nwho have never developed the kiss in any\nform.\nThere could not be a more essentially\nvulgar fashion than that of indiscrim\ninate kissing , and yet , curiously enough ,\nit is most affected by the classes and the\nindividuals who make the greatest pre\ntensions to refinement and culture. It\nis the exclusive woman of society who\nviolates a fine reserve in bestowing her\nkisses upon feminine compeers , right\nand left ; it is the stickler for etiquette\nwho commits an impertinence in talcing\ntin's unwarrantable liberty merely be\ncause it is fashionable.\nAnd the poor babies ! There is now\nand then a mother wise enough to re\nfrain from tormenting her tender infant\nwith caresses in season and out of season ;\nbut such instances are rare ; we must go\nto Japan for instruction and example\nupon this point : Japanese mothers ,\nthough remarkably gentle and affection\nate , never kiss their young children.\nA favorite situation with novel writers\n( even Howells condescends to use it ) is\nthat of a bereaved mother \"hungry\" to\nget hold of somebody else's baby , and\nthe unctuous description of the kissing\nand \"mumbling\" of the little body are\nsuggestive of a reversion to the cannibal\npropensities of our remote ancestors and\nvery humiliating to any woman desirous\nof the worthy development of her sex.\nFortunately for the future of good\nmanners and good health , the German\nphysicians have lately begun a crusade\nagainst the kiss as a fruitful dissemina\ntor of contagious diseases , and already ,\nin Germany , Satire has aimed aii effec\ntive blow at an evil which no other\nweapon seemed likely to reach.\n\"May I kiss you ? \" asks the lover of\nhis beloved , and she replies : \"Are you\naware that science has declared kissing\nto be the surest way of communicating\nthe microbes of disease ? \"\nMake a thing ridiculous , and , if pos\nsible , disgusting , and its doom is sealed.\nOne might suppose that Hobsou's\nosculatoiy progress would have made\nindiscriminate kissing both ridiculous\nand disgusting in America ; but the\npress has just recorded a confirmation of\nthe scientific view in giving notice of\n\"eight cases of smallpox and one death\ntraceable to kissing indulged in at n\nchurch sociable' ' in a western town. At\nsuch meetings for pious pleasure kissing\nplays are permitted and encouraged ,\nalthough it is considered wicked to\ndance.\nELIZABETH E. EVANB.",

E. BLAOKMAN.\nIii THE CONSERVATIVE , May 23 , there\nappeared an article quoted from the\nNebraska City News , October 16 , 1858 ,\n\"Traces of Ancient Mines , \" in which\nthe writer , even at that early date ,\ncalled public attention to the extensive\nexcavations along the Weeping Water in\nthe vicinity of where Nehawka now\nstands.\nFrom that day to this , the mystery of\nthese strange evidences of ancient occu\npancy has been left undisturbed , except\nby a very few enquiring minds in the\nimmediate neighborhood. From time\nto time public notice has been directed\nto the spot by these interested parties ,\nbut no effort has been made to fathom\nthe mystery , which the early writer pro\nnounced unfathomable , except by Mr.\nIsaac Pollard , who owns the land where\none of these extensive groups of mines\n'is located. Mr. Pollard has made an ex\ntensive excavation of a cross-section of\nthis group , which admits of a careful\nstudy of the nature of the excavating ,\nwhich those Aborigines did to procure\ntheir flint.\nEvidence and Archaeology.\nThis early writer seemed to think that\n\"what this race achieved and what it\nthought , and what due curse , as in one\nnight , swept it from the earth , is , and\nprobably always will bo a mystery. \"\nNow , there are straws which tell\nwhich way the wind blows ; there are\ncoming events which cast their shadows\nbefore , and every act leaves an evidence\nwhich may be read by the keen-eyed ,\nmore plainly than the direction of the\nwind by the frivolous straw.\nThis great mine , for instance , will\naid us materially in the study of the\npeople who planned and worked it ; we\nknow they were mining experts and\nconducted the work with as much sys\ntem and science as the twentieth cen\ntury miner , with all his boasted skill ,\nuses today. Flint was the gold of the\nAborigine , and he contended against\nthe obstacles of nature as persistently\nfor his coveted flint as does the miner\nof today , for his all-powerful gold.\nThe chipped flints are an open book to\nthe archaeologist. They show by their\nform and material the class of people\nwho chipped them. The pottery used\nis also a true index to their characteris\ntics. These we find in abundance in\nthe vicinity of the names. Could they\nboth be found in the debris of the mine\nor on the uncovered floor of the mine ,\ntrue nature , in a general way , could be\ntold , but so far , diligent search has\nfailed to reveal but a single shard of\npottery and not a single perfect type of\nchipped flint. This is not strange , as so\nsmall an area has been opened and fur\nther work there may reward our efforts.\nCharacter of Flints Found.\nThe flints found on top of the earth\nare the \"Quivira Type , \" as found in the\nKansas field by Brewer ; a very rude ,\ncoarsely-chipped specimen. I took sev\neral hundred specimens , more or less\nperfect types , during my stay.\nThere is also found the \"Harahey\nType\" as described and illustrated by\nBrower. These two types seem to pre\ndominate , although a few specimens are\nfound which do not come under either\ntype. The Harahey flint is smooth and\nfine , being thin and evenly chipped ,\nshowing much skill in their manufac\nture. There is an individuality about\nthese chipped flints , and I am almost\nready to go on record as one who be\nlieves that they are the work of the\nsame people , although they differ so\nwidely in the skill of manufacture ; they\nwere simply made for a different pur\npose , hence the wide difference in form\nand skill.\nLodge Circles.\nThe lodge circles excavated , showed\nevidences which bring them under the\nclass of lodge circles , excavated in the\n\"Lowe site\" and elaborated in these col\numns. Here I find the same burned clay\nmasses found at the \"Lowe site\" and\nthe mystery only deepens. The two\ntypes of flints both broken and perfect ,\nrest together , and pottery of three dif\nferent styles is found. One piece of\npottery taken , is as large as your two\nhands , the largest I have ever seen in\nthis state ; many fragments were found\nnearby , and we hope to construct a\nnearly perfect vessel. These pieces wore\nfound in a lodge circle , two miles south\nof Nehawka , on the farm of Mr. L. J.\nGriffith , at a depth of two and a half\nfeet. Two of the potshards have cloth\nimpressions on them.\nBones Exhumed.\nOne sepulture was excavated which\nyielded a few bones in an advanced\nstage of decay ; only the largest bones\nremained ; the vertebra and ribs were\na. rIP\nentirely decayed ; the greater part of the\nskull was secured. This skull\nis about a quarter of an inch thick IP\n. '\n*\nand has a very low brow ; the other pe '\nculiarities may bo determined after the\npieces have been joined and a more\ncareful study made.\nThis field demands more study than it\nis possible to devote to it at this time ,\nbut Mr. Barrett and Mr. Sheldon , who\nvisited me in camp , were much im\npressed with the importance of the work\nbeing done. They enjoyed two days of\nreal camp life and carried a heavy load\nof specimens back with them.\nA Weeping Water Graveyard.\nIn the near future , we will endeavor\nto arrange for some illustrations of the\ntypes of flint found , and when leisure\nwill permit , I will try to outer more in\nto detail , but during the summer wo can\nbarely state briefly what we find.\nMr. A. Tumbley , of Nebraska City ,\ngave me letters of introduction to gen\ntlemen in Weeping Water , and I stopped\nto investigate a graveyard there. It\nproved to be a very high mound which\nhad been opened a number of times. I\nsecured two flints and many shards of\npottery on the surface , which serve to\nidentify it as belonging to the same people\nple as did those at Nehawka.\nWe may have small evidences to\nguide us in archaeology , but so we have\nin any science , and a little care and\nmuch searching will yet give us the true\nhistory of these Aborigines. One thing\nis certain , they were not lazy as are the\nrecent Indians , although it seems evi\ndent that they were the remote ances\ntors of the same.\nTheories Regarding the Mines.\nMany theories have been proposed rel\native to these mines from time to time ;\none of these as related by Mr. E. A.\nKirkpatrick , may be of interest in this\nconnection.\nA number of years ago as this gentle\nman was passing through a little town in\nwestern Iowa ; he met a gentleman who\ntold him the following story :\n\"I have never been in Nebraska , but\nonce , then I went to the gold mines\nsouth of the Platte river about twelve\nmiles. You follow up the stream that\nempties into the Missouri about twelve\nmiles south of the Platte , for some eight\nmiles , until you come to a little branch\nwhich joins it from the north ; about , two\nmiles due north of this point is a high\nhill , which is doubtless an ancient gold\nmine. It is left in deep pits , and the\nold furnaces were still there when I vis\nited it many years ago. I will tell you\nhow I came to go there : I found an old\nbook in my grandfather's library which\ntold of two men who went to this place\nto work the old abandoned Spanish\nmines. They collected a large quantity\nof gold and wore in the way to amass\ngreat wealth , when they were attacked\nthe Indians and had to run for their\nRri",

There is only one thing'\nto do, whether we approve daylight\nsaving time which we do or not.\nThat one thing, under the circum\nstances, is to go ahead and make ar\nrangements to do our work an hour\nearlier each day and get through an\nhour earlier. The railroad, by ad\nvancing their schedule; the large and\nemail cities near us; the banks and the\nmerchants have settled this matter\nfor us and we are obliged to take the\nbenefits of their actions and decisions\nwhether we like to or not which\nmost of us do.\nAnyone who says there is no con\nfusion under daylight savins as now\npracticed is a fanatic who distorts\nfacts. Of course there is confusion.\nBut the advantages to be gained are\nso infinitely greater than the \"confu\nsion,\" because of the good use to\nwhich the daylight is put, that the re\nsultant \"confusion\" sinks to petty im\nportance by comparison. There was\nconfusion when electricity supplanted\ngas as a means of Illumination. Peo\nple who had gas fixtures were obliged\nto purchase paraphernalia for electric\nlights. There was confusion when the\npopular method of transportation\nchanged from .horse-drawn vehicles\nto those propelled by motors. Not only\ndid men have to replace their wagons\nwith trucks but the whole traffic regu\nlations of the state and all the roads\nof the state had to be altered.\nEvery step in progress brings con\nfusion. That confusion is made by the\nones who refuse to see the obvious\nthe advantage of taking and using the\n\"goods the gods movlde.\" As this\nnewspaper declared a year or more\n'ago the time will come when there\nwill be no necessity for bothering with\nthe changing of the clocks. The ad\nvanced schedule will, in that day, go\ninto effect on a certain date by com\nmon consent'1, and the clock will go on\npointing to the same hours it has dur\ning the winter months. Dut in this\nperiod of transition into the light of\nnewsly recognized advantages to be\ngained by using daylight when day\nlight comes, it seems necessary to\nchange our clocks to remind many\npeople that the sun is shining.\nStop adding to the confusion by de\nstine- whether or not we, will go on\nHnviieht saving time.\" We've got to,\nand that's all there is to it.\norroRTi xmi:s to i.f.ar\nWhen printing was invented peopl\nwero irlvpit a chance (o learn of mat\ntcrs formerly out of their sphere\nWhen the stage conch was replaced\nby the railroad train, people; traveled\ngreater distances, of course, ami be\nfame familiar with peoples, whom\nthey might never have seen hod th\nstage couch remained the only mean\nof transportation, Affairs of the conn\ntry were d I no u used more freely, anil\ntho characteristics of people living a\na distance were taken into account\nwhen considering laws to govern them\nbecause legislators, moro traveled\nbetter educated by association with\nstrangers, If you will, knew better the\nthoughts of those strangers and their\ncustoms.\nIn a state like Connecticut, for In\nstance, a man or woman might oneo\nhave been e.cused \" for being com\nparatlvely Ignorant of the habits and\ncustoms and mnnner of life of people\nliving at a great distance from them\nThey were to be excused for a certain\nnarrowness becauso of their inability\nto get about and learn to know others\nliving In distant localities.\nToday there arc comparatively few\ngeographical limitations. The auto\nmobile has made neighbors out of\npeople who years ago considered\nthemselves isolated from the rest of\nthe people of the state, or neighboring\nstates. . It Is nothing, today, for f\nwhole family to take a little automo\nbile drive which covers In a day t\nhundred or more miles. Jn the space\nof a few days the whole state may be\nvisited thoroughly. .This situation im\nposes upon us a responsibility to make\nthe most of this opportunity. Such\ntrips may mean only pleasure, with\nnothing more substantial. There may\nbe no thought of the wonderful\nchance the automobile gives us to be\ncome more familiar with our new\nneighbors \"new\" because they are\nnow as accessible as were dwellers in\nforeign countries many years ago,\nThere remains no excuse for narrow\nIgnorance. There is r.o excuse, today\nfor considering certain habits, cus\ntoms the perfect ones because they\nare characteristic of the people in the\n\"home town.\" With the pleasure of\nthe automobile has come the respon\nsibillty of broadening ourselves and\ngaining a certain amount, at least, of\nthe cosmopolitan spirit which refuses\nto stamp anything as \"proper\" or\n\"improper\" merely because it is or it\nis not done \"in my town.\"\nRAILROAD AFFAIRS\ni n-,nllinfi ttlP XeW\nu ranKiy, . u\njt , . rr.itr.nn-n hnnkrf at\nHaven roau w \"\"\"-\n.jri mtoa would mean better\nservice and benefits to the people a\nindividuals, one would be inclined to\nhope that the appeal of the inter\nstate commerce commission, to com\npel the road to issue such mileage\ni i. rr,iv,t hrlne- results. But no\nsuch advantage would come -to the in\nHlvlrlual from a decision compelling\nWch issue. In fact it Is to be feared\nthof tVia reverse would be true, at\nleast in the matter of service.\nThe Washington correspondent of\nThe Herald states that a somewhat\npoorer condition of rolling stock lm\nrirovement is shown by the New\nHaven road than on the railroads as a\nwhole throughout the United States.\nThe details of the showing of the\nroad in this regard were published In\nthis newspaper yesterday. Now It is\nquite certain that the New Haven has\nnot fallen behind other roads in this\nmatter because of any desire on the\npart of the road to fail to Improve the\ncondition of its rolling stock. It, like\nthe owner of any other property,\nwants to see Its property kept in good\ncondition. Undoubtedly it is making\nan effort to improve that condition.\nImproved rolling stock means better\nservice and better service is what\nthe Individual wants. If forced to is\nsue mileage books at $72, this amount\nrepresenting reduced rates for those\nwho could buy 2,600 miles of trans\nportation at one time, it is quite cer\ntain that the funds available for Im\nprovement of rolling .stock would be\ndecreased, while tho occasional user\nof the road would not be benefited.\nIt is a question, also, whether or\nnot. In the long run, 'the mileage book\nat this price would benefit immediate\nly the concerns which would save\nmoney by their use. Above all the\nservice must be improved and even a\nsaving of transportation cost, If made\nat the expense of the rolling stock\nand .the service, would not be a\npermanent advantage.\nCAMP FOR MOTORISTS\nAgain it seems advisable to repeat\nthe warning against adopting the plan\ntor a camp for automobilists in this\ncity until the matter has been thor\noughly investigated. Let it be granted,\nif necessary, that the expense connect\ned with the camp would be slight;\nthat a small fee might be charged to\nhelp defray, or to entirely defray any\nsuch expenses. Granted that all prac\ntical arrangements might be made\nwithout taking labor away from other\nwork to be done in the city, in order\nto prepare the camp and the neigh\nborhood for it. It Is by no means cer\ntain that there would not be some\nproblems in connection with these\nmatters, but let them be deckled in\nfavor of the camp for the purpose\nof this comment.\nNevertheless there remain certain\nmatters that are of even greater im\nportance, the chief of which, perhaps,\nis tho comfort and wish of the people\nofthe city, especially tne people, living\nin the neighborhood of the proposed\ncamp. The; people of New Britain\nshould be considered, of course, be\nfore the motorists who pass through\nNew Britain, or others who would use\nthe camp. Do the residents of the\nIlelviderc section want a Camp located\nIn that neighborhood? Many of them\nhave purchased property there, or\nrented property in that locality, look\ning forward to the joys of spring and\n.summer In that delightful section\nwhich has its drawbacks in winter.\nThey have put up with many things,\ndisadvantages due to the newness of\nthe section as a residential' district,\nknowing they will be compensated by\nIts beauty in the warm months. Will\nthe establishment of a camp there\ntake away from them some comfort\n(o which they had a right to look for\nward? This Is the first eonsidera\nHon. Other matters that should be in\nvestignted at once are the character\nof the people who make use of such\ncamps; the effect such camps have\non the summer night life of a city;\nthe possibility of such a place becom\ning a rendevous of an undesirable na\nture and many other matters which\nhac cropped up most unexpectedly\nin towns and cities where this experi\nment has been tried.\nIt Is not the desire, here, to dis\napprove the Idea unconditionally. It\nIs the sinorre desire, however, to em\nphasic again the importance of get\nting information from those who have\nhad experience with such camp be\nfore committing this city to the plan.\nthe habit of culling attention to a\nmutter which show 1 be i , ,,,),, ... ,\nat tho time memory of It is fresh. To\nday we may point' to the fact (hut\nfalls on Icy slilewnlka In thla city cost\nthe laxpuycrs nearly $3,000 and, in\ncldenlnlly, they wero lucky to get out\nof It for that amount, The claims\ncommittee and the corporation coun\nsel did effective work In bringing\nabout compromises, thus, probably\nsuvlug the city many hundreds, per\nhaps thousands, of dollars, without\ninjustice- to those who wero unfortttn\nate enough to be Injured by fulling on\ntho walks.\nTho mutter to be emphasized now,\nwhile the memory is fresh, Is that pre\ncautions should bn taken, os far us\npossible, to reduce this amount by\nmaking the walks as safe as possible\nfor next winter. This matter was\nmentioned at the lust session of the\ncommon council, and it was satisfac\ntory to note that the' clty engineer has\nmade It u point to see that at least\none of tho walks in tho city, upon I\nwhich there were many falls, will not\nbe. reproduced In new walks when\nsuch new walks are built. The smooth\nfinish will be abandoned in this one\ncase, at least, and the Bmooth finish\non concrete walks should not be al\nlowed to be used. In the construction\not new walks this summer, this mat\nter should be borne In mind. They\nshould be built always with the end in\nview of making them safe at a\ntimes of a character that will not In\ncrease the \"icy walk\" hazard. Care\nshould bo taken as to means of drain\ning walks so that they will not be\ncontinually covered with Ice when the\nfreeze comes after the thaw. This one\nstep, at least, should be taken by in\ndivlduals for the sake of all the tax\npayers of the city in the great light\nto keep down taxes'. j\n, z Z .\n25 Years Ago Today\n(Taken from Herald ot thai date)\nFacts and Fancies\nBY ROBERT GULLEX.\nLet me live in a house by the side\nof tho road and sell gasoline to man.\nEven those who travel the strait\nand narrow may detour at intervals,\nA good man can force his way\nahead almost anywhere except in a\ncafeteria line.\nArchaeology teaches us that there\nare rewards in unlikely places for\nthose who will dig.\nA good paint job can hide the\nmarks of time, dear lady, but it won't\nchange the chassis.\nAnother good sanity test is the pos\nsession of a car that is capable of\nmaking eighty miles an hour.\nThere were five deaths recorded and\nflvo inarrlag't licenses In Ken out at\nthe office of the town clerk the past\nweek.\nTimothy Rums, u plumber, had an\nunpleusant experience yesterday. , He\nwas doing some work und while blow.\nIng on: a gusolino torch Hie Humes\nburst Into his fuce.

Ralph H, Baldwin, chaplain\nto the Bishop of New York, submitted\nthe llrst paper. Ho stated that the\nBible sketches history; archaeology\nwrites It in tho spirit of science. It bus\nshown that the Hebrew nation did not\ndwell upon a desert Isle, but lived In\ntouch with world. Archaeology Illumi?\nnates the page on which Is written the\nhistory of the world. For every Chris?\ntian it has a message, Its research hav?\ning thrown a Hood of light?a knowl?\nedge of the customs, places and events\nof sacred story. Certain critics have\nignored Its voice, but a study of arch?\naeology has been pursued successfully\nfor many years now by scholars of all\nschools. Its discoveries have revolu?\ntionised our Ideas of Oriental history,\nand prove that Moses could have writ?\nten the pentatcuch, thus destroying the\nassumption of the critics that he did\nnot write it. We own a debt to archaeo?\nlogy for tho identification of localities\nand tho history of many of the peoples\nof other times. From it we get much\ninformation of the past that is not In\nthe Bible. It was. however, by no will\niff man, but by the grace of Ood that\nthe records of tho past have been pre?\nserved, nnd the information they give\nis of enormous value In substantiating\nthe record of the Bilde, this information\nbeing of Incalculable value to the stu?\ndent and scholar. Save as we encour?\nage or retard the workers In archaeo?\nlogy do we hasten or delay the coming\nof the lime when the history of the past\nwill bo more fully known. Archaeology\nis building anew for us a knowledge of\nthe breadth and depth of the reality of\nthe time when the world was young.\nII iloes away with theorizing and\nleaches that all things come from Ood.\nAs we look through this wonderful glass\nof history and see the figures that play?\ned so large a part In the history of\nearly times, we cannot out return lo the\nBook of Books with renewed confidence\nund pleasure.\nThe Rev. Professor Angus, of the\nTheological Seminary of Virginia, read\nthe next paper. Ho said that the study\n.of archaeology had inspired Christians\nwith the hope that many quest Ions how\n? lark and misunderstood would finally\nbecome plain. It lias been assumed\nthat In the time of Moses the art of\nwriting was unknown, nnd there was\nnothing outside of the Bible to disprove\nthis assumption. There was no means\nof explaining many apparently unrea?\nsonable things that wore stated In the\nBible, and these facts were emphasized\nby the critics. Their assumptions have,\nhowever, been found baseless through\nthe spade of the explorer. Arebac ilogy\nproves that we hadn't the faintest con?\nception of the civilization of the post.\nThe relics In the museums would chal?\nlenge comparison with the most won?\nderful evidences of art to lie seen in\nTiffany's windows in New York. We\nnow know that lr.iiJ B. (*. was a wonder?\nful literary period. In the light of the\nrevelations of archaeology the critics\n:mw give up the assumption that the\npatriarchs couldn't write. The earlj\nnarratives of the Bible can now l>c at?\ntested and we no longer depend upon\n(he unsupported statements of the in?\nspired writers. The civilization of Ihoi ?\nages was vastly superior to anything\nwe had ever conceived of it.\nOriental archaeology, too, makes us\nrevise our commentaries. By it we can\ndate prophecies, and even the reigns of\ncertain kings. The very names of some\nof the Oriental chiefs have come tu llghi\nthrough it. Hitherto we have had noth?\ning with which to compare the Hebrew\nrace. Its moral concept ions, etc. Arch?\naeology has brought oUI an ethical i I -\nmen) In Israel which quickened her ra?\ntional conscience?of which her neigh?\nbors hardly dreamed; it shows that she\nwas designed to be a perm.neu: force\nIn the world, which force found its d -\nvelopment in Christ. it shows, too,\nmust fortunately, thai there was no'\nlong difference in time between the\nhappenings In the early book.- pf tie\nBib!\" and the making of the records\nthemselves, which fact gives to them so\nmuch more value, it has established\nbeyond question the literary condition\nof the patriarchal times; that the facts\nof the Bible were not floating around\nfor renturies and orally transmitted,\nbut that they were recorded from a-.\nt;> age as the events occurred. Critics\nhave assumed that the literary condi?\ntions of the early times did not permit\nof the writing of such books ns those\nof the Pentateuch, hut i: is certain thai\narchaeology lends nothing to tin- sup?\nport of th*> theory of a later authorship\nshows nothing thai would discredit the\nrecord of the Bible as to this. It has\nbeen held lhat Israeli In the time of\nMoses, was it small band of nomadic\nshepherds, hut we now have a marvel?\nous attestation of the Biblical record!\nThe critics have boon nil astray in their\nassumptions and the conclusions drawn\nfrom their wrong premises have been\nBWCpt away.\nHereafter wo must wait till the re?\ncords have spoken and not depend upon\nthe intellects of the nineteenth cen?\ntury critics.\nThe audience gave the reader an ova\n?.??iii of applause at the close of the\npaper.\nTHE ADDRESSES.\nThe hymn, \"Father of Mercies,\" was\nsung, and the speaker on tho topic. Prof.\nA. V. Williams Jackson, Ph. D.. profes?\nsor of languages In the Columbia Uni?\nversity, New York, quite a yqpng man\n?one of the youngest who has ad?\ndressed the Congress?was introduced,\nj He Is a very graceful nnd pleasant\nspeaker. He s:?d he felt like, Chaucer,\nI that he hadn't much to say, after what\nI had been so well said on the subject\n1 under discussion; that he would not\ni Speak ns a scholar, but as a humble\nj churchman who has seen the import?\nance of archaeology In Illustrating tho\n? sacred text. The scholar, ho said, has\ncome in and made the rocks to speak.\nand as we see tho ancient Inscriptions\nwe can appreciate the sacred record bet?\nter. By the revelations of arclyaeology\nwe can see how the spade has been used\nto turn up diamonds for the crown that\nIs to give so much light to the world.\nWo can think with pleasure of these\nsch6lars working In their quiet way to\nbring to us the light that will illumine\nnot only the old Bible, but the new, as\nwell as the words of Christ, whose name\nwe bear and under whoso bknner we\nwork.\nAt times the speaker was very elo?\nquent, and he Is gifted In word paint?\ning, which served him well as he fol?\nlowed the explorers after truth In their\nresearches In distant lands.\nThe last speaqcr was Rev. John P.\nPeters. D. DV, of New York, who is a\nnoted archaeologist, and was the leader\nof an exploring party in ancient lnnds.\nHe said that archaeology Is a part of\nthe modern crltlcul apparatus. It has\ntaken both archaeologists and higher\ncritics to Interpret certain passages. It\nwould not have been possible In some\ninstances for archaeology to have clear?\nly done It alone. Before anything hud\nbeen discovered archaeolog ically In Pal?\nestine, the speaker himself had attract?\ned attention to a passage In Jeremiah\nthat seemed to indicate that there\nwould be discoveries of this sort in that\npart of the world. Till full researches\nhave been made through archaeology\nJudgment should be withheld; The dif?\nficulty has been thai higher criticism of\none age has been adopted in the theo?\nlogy and then In later years had to bo\ngiven up. Explorations have already\ngone back 2,000 years before Archbishop\nUsher?by his llgu res?created the\nworld.\nThe difficulty with critics Is that they\ncould not lind In the oilier books of the\nBible that Moses wrote those attribut?\ned to him. The words. \"'First Cook of\n.Moses.\" us they appear in the Bible\nwere not in the original text. Those\nwords conic from higher critics of an?\nother time. What we must do Is to ex?\nplore back nearer the source of tho\ntradition as to the authorship. Many of\nthe dates in the Bible are not from the\noriginal text, but they are from the\nGreek School of Alexandria. Many\nIlling.? are in the Bible and believed to\nbe In the original text, but those things\nare the work of higher critics of other\nages. It might be thought that there\nis nothing in archaeology to determine\npositively the tiling's of which It treats,\nbut it is a science just as is higher\ncriticism. Put the spade into Palestine\nthen, and recover the treasures there\nhidden.\nTo Instance what archaelogy Is worth:\nI had learned from the best sources of\ninformal ion that the ancient city of\nGaxa was situated several miles from\nthe present town of Gaza, but when I\nwas at the hitter place place I noticed a\nhill that looked like a natural hill, but\nwhich, on close Investigation, proved to\nbo a heap of delbrts. At the base we\nfound the earth slipping away and\nthere discovered the wall of the ancient\n?iy, giving the lie to what was con?\nsidered up to that time as the besl au?\nthority on the subject. Great results\narc awaiting the touch of the spade in\nPalestine.\nThe hymn, \"O, Word of Qod Incar?\nnate.\" was sung and the Congress ad?\njourned till s p. in., with benediction\nby Bishop Randolph.\nThe Academy of Music was packed\nagain last evening to hear Ihe discus?\nsion of ihe tonic \"Progress In the Iri\niterpretatlon of Christian Symbols.\"\nBishop Randolph conducted the open?\ning exercises and introduced the first\nwriter, Itev. \\V. M. Hughes. D. !>.. of\nM?rrlstown, N. .).. who said In part:\n\"llow do we know that we have exact\nfacts; how <Vo we know that our religion\nis to be made a mockery by the men who\narc too orthodox to niter their views'.'\"\n\"If .leans be not the essence of Incar?\nnate being, then he fails io reveal to us\nsome mystic holy of holies, if this l>e\ntrue, to what religion shall we revert?\nShall we adopt the aneieiil Olympian\nfaith or thni of latter day pessimism?\n\"To avoid either of these we Chris?\ntian soldiers are lighting.

Ktlltor.H\nnnd Griuluutcs or Hnuiptoii<\nThe second day's exercises attendant\nupon the dedication of ithe Armstrong\nSlater Memorial Trade and Industrial\nSchcol at Hampton, was attended by\nmembers of the Episcopal Church Con?\ngress, in session In this city, 'who went\nover to tho number of 250 on the steamer\nHampton Ro>ad&i which had been char?\ntered especially for the occasion. The\nparty left Norfolk at 1 :30 o'clock, and\narriving at Hampton an hour later, they\nrepaired immediately -to the Memorial\nChurch, whore tho exercises were held.\nThe building was well filled when the\ndelegation of clergymen -arrived, and by\nthree o'clock It was packed und the au?\ndience overflowed tor.he stepstand lawns\nsurrounding the church.\nBishop Randolph opened the session,\nand on the platform were, besides the\nprominent Episcopal clergymen, many\ngraduates l\" the institution, men who\nby their own life-work have demonstrat?\ned the value of the course given al\nHampton, and who a:e living examples\nor the fact that through education or\nthe proper hind, teaching them ?;<> help\nthemselves and to teach others, both\nthe Indian und the negro race can be\nmade great people.\nA m .-: Inl resting feature Of the ox\nerclses was the plantation songs ren?\ndered by the student choir.\nTiie ilrst speaker was Dr. Frissell,\nprincipal of the institution, who spoke\nas follows.\nIn one of bis early reports, General\nArmstrong, speaking of the colored poo-'\npie of Uiis country, says: \"The race will\nsucceed or fall us it shall devote itself\nwith energy to agriculture und the me?\nchanic arts, or avoid these pursuits,' and\nits teachers must be inspired with tho\nspirit of hard work and acquainted with\nthe ways that lead to success.\" He goo.!\non to say that the pant of the colored\npopulation has been such that an insti?\ntution devoled especially to them must\nprovide n iraining more than usually\ncomprehensive, must Include both sexes\nand a variety of occupation, must pro?\nduce moral as well as mental Strength,\nand while makine its students first-class\nmechanical laborers, must also make\nthem llrst rate men and women.\nTRAINING OF TEACHERS.\nI This thought of Hampton's wise and\nfar-sighted founder has shaped and still\nshapes tin- policy of the school. In the\n[early days of the Institution, ami, in\nTai l, nil through its history, especial\nprominence has been given to the train?\ning of teachers for the public schools or\nthe South. In order to lit them to lie\nreal lenders of their race, much more\nwas needed than mere ins\".ruction in\nbooks. Habits of living nnd or regular\nindustry had to he formed. Two farms,\nsixteen shops, a large saw mill, the glfl\nof Mr. l\". I'. Huntington; have helped\ntowards this end. An Industrial village\nhits grown up, with Us dormitories,\nschool rooms, siov.-; nnd otlloos, where\nthe work of rial life is carried on.\nEvery student is no I merely a learner,\nhut a worker with regular duty's and\nthe responsibility of self help.\nPRACTICAL LESS) INS.\nThe iessdn <-f the school room is put\ninto practice in tin- shop or on the farm.\nThe problems or arithmetic, or natural\nphilosophy are connected with the no\nttiitl work of every day life, and so the\ngraduates id' Hampton have been fitted\nnot merely to teach in the si loud room,\nbut to build the house and bring up the\nworn out soil.\nThe young people have learned, not\nonly to do their work well, but to know\nwhat their work menus. They have\nlined a spirit of self-reliance end of\nmanliness: they have gone out as clll\nscens, able t<> teach by example and pre\ni right ideas of life and duty.\nCRISIS IN NEGROES HISTORY.\nIi has become clear that still further\nchanges are necessary in order that the\nwork which the school's founder planned\nbe onrrled out. with Hie growth ot in?\ndustrial schools in th - South, there\ncomes a demand upon Hampton ror\nmore mechanics than the sclio >l qan\nsupply through her apprenticeship sys?\ntem. Not only is there need for more\nindustrial teachers for the schools of\nthe South, but for more men scientifi?\ncally trained in the theory and princi?\nples <,r the trades than was possible in\nShops where production ami Instruction\nwere carrlqd pi) together. Moreover,\nt ie i ,' sei ms to those of us who ha re to\ndeal with this negro problem a crisis\nin the history of the race. In certain\npart's of the South the colored people are\nnot holding their own In the trades\nwhich were taught in slavery days. As\nthe trades unions <.f tie- North push into\nthe South the negroes tiro being driven\nfrom the carpenter's bench arid the\nblacksmith's shop, ami thus forced into\nth - more menial occupations. Unless\nHampton, Tuskegoo, ami other indus?\ntrial schools of the South, can supply\nno n capable of sinning shops tor their\nown race, and of eiopioyin;; and training\ncolored mechanics, there will bo little\nchance for the negro for holding the\nhost heritage loft him by slavery.\nMAKE GOOD FARMERS.\nNot only is it necessary that Hampton\ndo hotter work In the trades; It Is quite\nas l.TTportanl that it push the matter of\nmproved Instruction in agriculture und\ndomestic science. The building to be\nopened to-day is one of three, the plans\nof which have already been submitted\nto the trusti es of tie- Hampton Institute\nand the educational committee of the\n?lohn F. Slater Fund Board, and ap?\nproved by them.\nSALVATION tiF TWO BACKS.\nThe salvation <>f He- negro and the\nIndian lies very largely In gaining and\nproperly cultivating the soil. They havi\nnow an opportunity to obtain land at\ncheap rates. This opportunity will not\nong continue. Already there Is a move?\nment on tho part or settlers of th\"\nNorthwest towards the rich, unoccupied\nlands oi\" the Southern states, while tin\nreservat Ion land of the Indian is eagerly\nnought by Western farmers. Hampton\nmust stitl out enlhusldtlc agricultural?\nists, in order to accomplish this, lie\nstudents who go out from here must\nnot only have been put through the reg\nular routine of farm work, but must\nhave thorough, systematic Instruction\n(Continued on the Klghth Page.)\nIS A GOOD TIME TO SELECT A NEW SUIT FOR\nTHAT BOY OF YOURS.\nTHE HUB\"\nhas just received from Bal?\ntimore headquarters scores\nof new and pretty effects in Juvenile Suits in a superb\nvariety of winsome weavings.

To be true and to be genuine.\nNo education is worth anything that\ndoes not include this. A man had\nbetter not know how to read, and be\ntrue and genuine in action, rather\nthan be learned in all sciences and in\nall languages, and be at the same\ntime false in heart and counterfeit\nin life. Above till things, teach the\nbovs that truth is more than riches,\npower or possessions.\n2. To be unselfish. To care for the\nfeelings and comforts of others. To\nbe generous, noble and manly. This\nwill include a genuine reverence for\nthe aged and for things sacred.\n4. To be self-reliant and self -helpful,\neven from childhood. To be in\ndustrious always, and self-supporting\nat the earliest proper age. Teach\nthem that all honest work is honor\nable ; that an idle life of dependence\non others is disgraceful.\nWhen a boy has learned these thing\nsays a writer in an exchange, when\nhe has made these ideas part of him\nhowever poor or however rich he\nhas learned the most important\nthings he ought to know.\nTO ENCOUEAGE N.

His advice concern\ning gaudy apparel reminds me of an\narticle that I read some time ago\nfrom the pen of an American who\nhas spent much time in Paris. She\nwrites of fashions but declares that\nnothing impressed her so much as the\nquiet, subdued graynessof that great\ncity compared with our gayly colored\ncities and towns. From her window\nin Boston she counted twenty differ\nent colored houses. This impressed\nher as a common lack of refinement\nand I fear that her opinion is voiced\nby many strangers who visit our\nshores. A conglomeration of colors\nthrown together without regard to\nharmony or geneneral effect, a seek\ning after the gaudy and showy, in\ndicate vulgarity, while subdued col\nors indicate refinement.\nI am sorry for you, Betsy.

In fact, the boys seem\nto have deserted with the exception\nof Will Retlaw and Tennessee Boy\nwho are adding somewhat to the\ngaiety of the nations.\nI have no special subiect, but win\nmake a little running comment on\nthe topics of the day. All the girfc\nare talking of fashions and sprin\ndresses, while members of my 0Wn\nsex devote every spare moment to\npolitical questions. Now I am not\nan expert either in matters of dress\nor of government but I have a fe\nopinions regarding both. As for\ndress, so long as girls or boys\ndress neither shabbily nor gaudily\nthey are safe. One extreme is as\nbad as the other. The aim should In\nto occupy the safe middle ground.\nIn my opinion when a person is so\ndressed,whether gayly or shabbily.us\nto attract attention to the apparel,\nthat person is badly dressed. With\nme the only impression I get from a\nproperly attired person is that tho\nperson is neatly dressed ; my at ten\ntion is attracted to the wearer and\nnot to the apparel. It is only the\nshabby or overly-dressed person\nwhose raiment fixes itself in my\nmemory. But it must be remem\nbered that I am writing from a mas\nculine standpoint; of my acquaint\nances among the gentler sex many a\none can tell you the color, quality\nand style of the dress of each and\nevery woman that attended her\nchurch last Sunday and possibly for\nseveral Sundays previous. But\nfrom my standpoint, a dress that\nexcites attention is not the one to\nwear.\nLikewise, about fashion : the mid\ndle ground is safest. There is an\nold, but none the less honorable,\ncouplet that runs in this manner :\n\"Be not the first by whom the new\nis tried ;\nNor yet the last to lay the oil\naside.\"\nBut I had better drop the subjects\nof dress and fashion. I feel a little\nmore at home in the discussion of\npolitical matters. And here I shall\nadvocate the same principle that I\nha ve supported in my remarks on\ndress and fashion. Don't be a slave\nof political fashions. Have con vie\ntions of your own and vote them.\nDon't be gaudy : that is, don't arouse\nattention by fiery and passionate\nutterances. Don't be shabbv : that\nj'is, don't follow the old ruts marked\nj out by party bosses. Politically I\ni am most interested in getting a legis\nlature that will give us four month's\npublic schools, a reformatory ir\nyoung criminals, and relief for the\nchildren in our factories.\nWell, the flowers are here and how\nbeautiful they are ! I trust that no\nreader of the Social Chat is so\nmaterialistic as to begrudge the time\nor little money spent in beautifiyins\nyards and grounds with them. But\nI have said enough and must close.\nCarelkss Tom.\nHOW YOU SAY IT.\nThere is much in the way a thins\nis said. \"Your cheeks arc like\nroses, \" said Aunt Flora, when Lois\ncame in from a January walk, glow\ning from the cold and exercise.\nLois smiled, and looked loving\nat Aunt Flora. Aunt Margaret en\ntered the room a minute later, ami\nglancing at Lois as she stood by the\nfire, said, -'My ! Your face is as red\nas a beet !\"'\nThe red grew deeper on Lois\" faee,\nwhile unsciously she turned pcttf-\ni lantly away from Aunt Margaret.\nj who prides herself on being '-plain\nj sp)oken.\nI like Aunt Flora's way best\nShe\ncan sav the riirht word at the rig\nht\nri\ntime, too, even the word of adm\"nl\ntion and reproof, but she says it 'n\nsuch a manner that one can think\nj only of the scriptural \"apples of g\nId\nin pictures of silver.\" Woman\nHome Companion.\nWe meet at the table three times a\nday in most families, and our bes\nopportunity for conversation is f oun1\nthere.

Mamie sat where\nhe had left her.\nShe bad conquered that wild impulse\nto sob and moan and was plaiting the\nfringe on the sofa arm with nervous\nfingers.\n\"Good! I am glad you are not the\nhysterical sort that never stops crying\nwhen it once gets started. Adrien's wife\nwas that kind. \u201d\n\"Where is Annabel?\"\n\"In Cuba,* the last we heard of her.\nI will give her the money to travel to\nJericho if only she will leave ns at\npeace. But\u2014no, Martin is on the tapis\njust now. If he never earned the right\nto bo called a hero daring the war,\nchild, be has during the harsher period\nof reconstruction. Who but ho could\nhave held in check the yelling, cursing,\ndrinking demons that were howling for\nthe blood of every white man within\nthe radius of ten mile* when the bullet\nriddled body of that rogue, Westmnu,\nwas brought hero? It was a grand sight,\nthat boy Strong, pallid from the loss of\nblood, suffering the tortures of a thousand\ndeaths physically, springing in among\nthem and cowering them by tho mag\nnetic power of his voice and his daunt\nless will. And since then. Ostracized,\ndespised, misconstrued at every turn,\nho has pursued the. rough tenor of his\nway with a dignity, an impartiality, a\nsuperb indifference to consequences that\nhave marked him a truly great man. \u201d\n\"He is fortunate in his eulogist,'' said\nMamie, smiling faintly into the fervent\nold face by her side.\n\"His eulogist! Not so. I am doing\ntho man simple, bald justice. He has\nput this community where It could not\nhave been put iu a quarter of a century\nin point of prosperity unaided by his\nindomitable will and superior control\nof the freed masses of ignorance and la\nziness wo have had to cope with. I tell\nyon, girl, we cannot afford to give\nStrong Martin up. The neighborhood\nneeds him. I need bim. lam an old\nman, my child, and I have no son to\nhold up my feeble hands. His brother\nSeth is a good, well meaning child, who\nwill live on, achieving his highest end\nShe drew hack close against the wall.\nIn administering Ms new nudes as man\nager and paymaster to the hirelings on\nmy place. He is well satisfied already\nwith the new order of things. But he\nis not Strong. Major Martin Is my\nnamesake, you know.\" This with pat\nent prida\n\"Yes, I know, I know, but I don\u2019t\nunderstand. You seem to be appealing\nto me\u2014throwing this whole awful re\nsponsibility on my shoulders.\"\n\u201cI do. I am. Ho is making his prep\narations to go away. He who for three\nyears now has endured the torture of\nostracism, hatred, injustice and cruelty\nfrom an entire neighborhood refuses any\nlonger to stand the obdurate discourtesy\nof one stubborn girl.\"\n\"And is It you, the old aristocrat,\nwho pleads the cause of the overseer\u2019s\nson?\"\n\"I owe it to him.\"\n\"You owe it to him?\"\n\"Yes, and a thousandfold more than\nI can ever repay. Girl, are yon resolv\ned to make my abasement still more\ngrievous? See, to carry my point, to\nbring a crumb of comfort to that noble,\ntired soul, I will tell you something I\nhad never thought to breathe into a\nmortal\u2019s ear. But if it will servo to con\nvince yon of the priceless value of the\ntreasure you are about to fling away ig\nnorantly I will bare even that scar for\nyour inspection.\n\u201cI owe Strong Martin a debt that far\nantedates aud far transcends the war\nrecord he has mode. Back yonder, In\nhis college days\u2014let mo tell it as brief\nly as possible\u2014my Adrien, poor weak\nson of a weak father, gambled himself\nInto a disgraceful predicament. Strong\nMartin suffered vicariously tor the un\ndetected wrongdoing of my grandson.\nHis whole life was affected by it. It\ndrove him into the enemy\u2019s ranks. It\nwas Adrien Strong who made a Federal\nof Strong Martin. It was from Adrien\u2019s\nown lips I received this confession,\nwhen he thought be was going to die of\n(be fever that made wreck of his intel\nlect Through all the iiubittered years\nof his young manhood the overseer\u2019s\nson protected my good name. Is that\nnothing to be grateful far? \u2022\n\"Only within the last year has he\nknown that I know how much 1 owe\nhim. I had not thought ever to let an\nother mortal know it. Now do you mar\nvel at my championship of his cause?\nDo you suppose it costs me nothing to\nplace this perilous confidence in a girl?\"\nShe turned her pitying, luminous\neyes foil upon him and laid her hand\ngently on his shoulder:\n\"I have known it oil those years. It\nwas for that I first loved him. If I could\nhave proved it on your grandson, I\nwould have done it\u2014done It gladly\u2014but\n\u2014did be\u2014did he send you here to say\nall this to mo?\"\n\"Martin scud me herol No. But\u201d\u2014\nbo bent his white bead in listening at\ntitude\u2014\"ho Is coming back for mo. I\nhear bis horses up the rood. \u201d Ho laid\nthe spray of sweet oli vo upon her folded\nhands. \"My dear, may I not carry that\nolive branch to him from yon? Love\nseldom chooses so crabbed a go between,\nbut I will carry your message to him\nfaithfully and gladly, little girl. You\nalone am keep him. We need him. Yon\nare driving him away from us.\"\nShe stood ap, trembling in every\nnerve.\n\"I cannot, I cannot\u2014l will not!\u201d\nWith a frightened cry she turned\naway from him. The olive branch lay\ncrushed and bruised beneath the old\nman\u2019s heel. Ho ground it deeper into\nthe matted floor, got up and went away\nwithout another glance at her. She\nheard him pace slowly down the garden\nwalk, heard the gate close behind him,\nand a second later knew, by the furious\ntrampling of horses\u2019 feet, that Strong\nwas conveying him homeward with all\npossible speed.\nThe long, hot, lonely day burned it\nself out at last. They dined late at Sans\nBond. Her father would not be coming\nhome before bedtime. The cicadas were\nshrilling in tbu locust trees behind the\ncottage. The fragrance of the sweet\nolive fell heavily upon the nix. Bho\nseated herself on the bench beneath It\nwith a book in her bond. Empty pre\ntense I She was a foe to pretense of any\nsort. And yet was she not pretending\nwith herself?\nShe stood up and broke off an olive\nbranch, threw it away and broke an\nother\u2014she had suddenly grown choice\nin the matter\u2014o fourth; at last one\nthat suited her exactly.\n\"Mrs. Morgan was discreet No one\nwould ever know. It was only a stop,\nJust to the end of the lane, and ho\naway at Sessumsport. \u201d\nMrs. Morgan was not only discreet,\nbut deaf. She started when the profess\nor\u2019s daughter, her face wrapped about\nwith a white cloud, stood suddenly be\nfore her, as she sat on her back porch\nflinging shelled com to her noisy feath\nered pensioners. Mamie stooped and\nlaid a small pasteboard box on her knees.\nThe old woman examined it curiously.\n\"What\u2019s this? Martin\u2019s name\u2019s on\nthe back of it. What am I to do with\nIt?\"\n\"Put it on his table, his bureau, any\nwhere where he will see it when he\ncomes home. And, Mrs. Morgan, dear\ngood Mrs. Morgan, pray never speak of\nmy bringing it\u2014yon know\u201d\u2014\n\"I know, I know, good child. I ain\u2019t\nbeen a toothless old hag all my life.\nHe\u2019ll get it Trust me for that.\"\nBut Mamie was far beyond roach of\nthese consolatory words. A few stops,\nlust to the end of the lane, and she was\nback home once more, quivering, flush\ning, blushing there all alone for the\nbold, foolish thing she had done.\nThe orescent moon came slowly up\nont of the east and found her sitting\nthere under the olive tree, wide eyed,\nnervous, expectant.\nThey dined late at Sans Souol. Her\nfather would not be home yet for an\nhour. The sliver moonbeams fell aslant\nof the crape myrtles by the gate and\nmade a square of brightness about Ik\nSomething was moving in the light.\nThe latch was lifted and dropped. Some\none was coming up the walk.\nThere had been no sound of wheels,\nthere was no sound ot orntonoa. in a\nsoft, frightened voioe she called:\n\"Father I\u2019\n\"Mamie!\"\n\"Is it yon? Oh!\"\nShe drew back close against the wall.\nFlight was her chief desire, but there\nwas no time for ik He had taken pos\nsession of the other end of her bench.\nHe laid his hat aside, and the light that\nsifted through the olive branches above\nthem showed her a noble head, a pallid\nface, a pair of burning eyes, a stern,\nchiseled month. He laid an olive branch\nupon her lap.\n\"Yon brought it to me voluntarily,\ndid yon not, dear?\u201d\nIt was the olive branoh she had left\nfor him such a little while ago. Denial\nwas impossible, acknowledgment was\ndifficult.\n\u2018 \u2018 yon\u2014yon\u2014how did you get it so\nsoon? I thought you were with the rest\nof them.\u201d\n\"Na I was at home, making my\npreparations for departure. The boat is\nlooked for about miduight. Yon brought\nme this dear token of good will volun\ntarily, did you not, Mamie? Don't trifle\nwith me any longer. The strain has\nlasted a long time. And it has boon se\nverer than you fancy. It must be lifted\ntonight. \u201d\n\"Yes\u2014l took it voluntarily. No one\ncould have made me do Ik \u201d\nShe bent her shining eyes on him aud\nmade her confession slowly.\n\"Does it mean all that I want it to\nmean, Mamie?\"\n\"How much do you want it to moan?\"\nIt was a shy whisper.\n\"All\u2014everything. I want it to mean\nindorsement, surrender, forgiveness,\nlove, happiness.\"\n\"I think I think\u2014oh, Strong,\nStrong, the unconquerable love of my\nheart constrains me I Yes, it means all\nthat. \u201d\nHe gathered her close to his heaving\nbreast. There was no uttered wort! of\nbetrothal, but under tbo sweet olive\nbranches they sat silent, contented, re\nunited. The moon mounted higher and\ngazed down upon them more inquisi\ntively. What she saw was a strong man\nholding a girl\u2019s slender hands clasped\ntenderly between his own. What she\nheard was a glad, tranquil voice mur\nmnring:\n\"Thank God! At last lam truly on\nthe winning side!\u201d\nTHE END.\nNine For Smoking In Street.\nAt one time if you smoked on tho\nstreets of Harrisburg after dark it cost\nyou sl. Back in 1889, when Samuel Pool\nwas president of the town council aud\nJ. Montgomery was clerk, it was deem\ned dangerous to permit people to smoke\non tho streets after dark, and tho council\npassed this ordinance: \u201cWhereas, tbo\nfrequent use of cigars in the streets,\nlanes and alleys of the borough in the\nevening renders Insecure every man's\nhouse and stable, and much danger is\nto bo apprehended from fire, therefore\nbo it ordained, etc., that after the due\npromulgation of this ordinance it shall\nnot be lawful for any person or persons\nto uso or carry along any of the streets,\nlanes or alloys iu this borough a lighted\ncigar or pipe after sundown under tho\npenalty of $1 for every such offense.\u201d\u2014\nHarrisburg Telegraph.\nCow* With Earrings,\nA oow is tho last creature one would\nexpect to see with earrings, yet every\ncow in Belgium has got to wear them\nnow. Tho director general of agricul\nture has issued a regulation that all\nanimals of the bovine species are to\nwear earrings ns soon ns they have at\ntained the ago of 3 months.\nThis is a hygienic measure, intended\nto prevent tho introduction into Bel\ngium of animals suffering from tuber\nculosis.\nBreeders are to be obliged to keep an\nexact account of all animals raised by\nthem, and the ring (on which is en\ngraved a number) is fastened in tho\nanimal\u2019s ear for the purpose of prevent\ning or helping to prevent tho substitu\ntion of one animal for another.\nVmx, Claws, Fingers*\nThe elephant, a slow moving animal\nIn the ordinary course, has five toes.\nThe rhinoceros, a much faster beast, os\nhunters have often learned to their con\nfusion, has but three. Now, in tho\nsheep wo find two digits only, while iu\ntho horse, peerless iu tho matter of\npace, tho number falls to a single digit.\nTbo nail of kite higher mammal may\nhave given place to a horny hoof. No\nmatter; the finger remains, for purposes,\nat any rate, of comparison, a finger all\nthe same. Be It added that many ex\ntinct hoofed creatures are endowed with\ntho full five digits, aud not a few ex\nisting deer show distinct traces of two\nobsolete shorter \"fingers.\u201d From this I\ngather\u2014though the theory may, not\nquite unreasonably, bo dismissed us far\nfetched \u2014that those weaker grass eaters\nhave gradually dropped their digits as\ntho struggle grew in severity and the\nnecessity for swiftness of limb increased.\nNor, I am free to confess, did the ap\nparent truth of this appeal to me in\nforce until I came to compare the foot\nof tho swift ostrich with that of the\nstately stork. It was as I expected, the\nfleet bird of tho desert had dropped two\nof the four fingers permitted to most\nbirds, having but two. Tho almost\nequally swift emu and cassowary had\ndropped one, being possessed of three\napiece. This, then, seems to mo a fair\nrule\u2014the fewer the digits the swifter\ntbo beast. And the rule bears the stamp\nof the exception necessary to prove it,\ninasmuch as the sluggish hippopotamus\nhas one less than the hare. Perhaps,\nthen, this notion of mine will apply only\nto the hoofed boasts. Whether tho ele\nphant might iu time have dropped one\nor two of his digits and at tho same\ntime dieted himself to acquire greater\npace is an open question, and one which\nsince the arrival on the scene of man\nand his rifle is likely to go unanswered.\n\u2014Good Words.\nGeneral Grant\u2019s Characteristics.\nHo was possessed of a moral and phys\nical courage which was equal to every\nemergency in which he was placed.

Oct. 17.\u2014\"There never\nwas an Eden. Man never was perfect\nand never by a single transgressi^i in\nvolved his whole posterity in guilt,'\u00ab\nsaid Rev. Dr. E. G. Hirsch last night irf\nhis sermqn at Temple Israel.\n\"The third chapter of Genesis.\" said\nDr. Hirsch, \"la the basis of the Chris\ntian system. It is held to teach that\nthe first man and the first woman lived\nin sinless perfection and In undisturb\ned peace and happiness in a garden of\ndelights for a long time, but eventual\nly lost all by a single act of sin. This\nsin. the theory Is, Infected their pos\nterity and brought the whole race un\nder the curse of God. To remedy this\na second Adam became necessary, who,\nby his death on the cross, should re\npair the damage done by the first\nAdam.\n\"Of the Christian doctrine of the\natonement I have no opinion to express\nat present. But I am here to defend\nJudaism against the charge of origi\nnating and holding this doctrine about\nEden and the fall of man. To do this\nit Is not necessary for me to quote tho\nwritings of the later rabbis. All that\nis necessary is to refer to the fact the\nstory of Eden is not mentioned any\nwhere in the Jewish Bible except in the\nthird chapter of Genesis. If It were\ntrue it would be of the greatest impor\ntance, and it would have been found\neverywhere in the Jewish writings.\n\"We reach the same conclusion If\nwe approach the subject from the direc\ntion of science. Nothing In science Is\nbetter settled than that the first man\nwas only a little better than the lower\nanimals, and that, instead of living in\nperfect enjoyment, his life was one of\nterrific struggle with the forces of na\nture and with living enemies.\n\"Geography and archaeology teach'\nus that thte story of Eden is untrue,\nfor no such place has even been dis\ncovered. The search has been continu\nous and many learned works have been\nwritten about it, but no progress haa\nbeen made and no light has been shert\non the subject. It is a law of natur\nthat every great event leaves vertigo\nbehind it. The black diamond con\ntains traces of vegetable origin. But\nnature contains no intimations of a\nParadise.\n\"But although this story of Eden Is\na mere fable, the Jews are not the an\nthors of it. It has beert well understood\nfor the last thirty years that the first\ntwelve chapters of Genesis did not\noriginate with the Jews. This was the\nsubject of Prof. Delitsch's lectures be\nfore Emperor William. Scholars hava\ndeciphered the inscriptions on the brick\ntablets of Babylon anr] made It certain\nthat the garden of Eden is Babylonish\nmyth, which the Jews brought with\nthem to Palestine when they returned\nfrom the Babylonish captivity.\n\"Genesis, however, is more valuable\nas a fable than it would have been us\nhistory. It Is divested of all the dog\nmatic meaning that Christian theolo\ngies give it, and becomes an agreeable\nand profitable lesson in human nature,\nshowing how human nature Is prone to\ndeny its imperfections and to lay its\nshortcomings on others.\"\nLittle Girl Badly Hurt.\nSpecial to The Globe.\nGLENWOOD, Wis..

Indianapolis News.\nThe Farm and the Man.\nFlow any farm should be cropped\ndepends upon where the farm is, its\ncharacter and location. Some farms\nare by nature pasture farms, because\nthey are not adapted to cultivatforJ;\nother farms Invite tillage. Size, too,\nis a controlling factor. A crop rota\ntion and schedule of farm work that\nIs admirable for fifty acres may be\nwholly Impracticable for five hundred\nor a thousand. The ambition to own\nand cultivate broad acres Is an Ameri\ncan disease. This disease Is not so\nmuch a desire to add to worldly pos\nsessions' as It is for a gratification of\nthe ownership of dominion; when an\nalyzed It will be found to be a feature\nof man's kinship with nature.\nAnother and the most Important fac\ntor of all Is the man himself. The\nman makes the farm good or bad, aa\nhe makes everything else that conies\nunder his control. The experience of\none farmer is invaluable to another,\nbut each farm is nevertheless a separ\nate and local problem which the farm\ner must think out and work out himself.\nReturn to Palestine Likely to Be\" by\n, Gradual Staees.\n; Israel Zangwlll, writing In , the\nWorld To-Day, says pertinently: \"The\nfreer the Jew Is left the more he tends,\nif not toward 'Christianity, toward a\nbroader view of It and toward the ac\nceptance of Christ In the apostolic\nchain of Hebrew prophets. \" The mod\nern Jew . is a pro-Chrlstlan, only too\neager to admire the Ideals of what\never nation he lives . amid, only too\nuncritical.

E. Kiser in Cleveland Leader.\nA VANISHED GROOM.\nIt was tho moment of Bupreniest pleas\nure to Abner. Tho wedding canopy had\nbeen raised, the benediction uttered, the\nring placed on the bride's finger, the kiss\ngiven to seal the union. She was bis own\nat last. His highest ambition had been\ngratified. With words of congratulation\nhis friends crowded around him. It was a\njoyous atmosphere Indeed, while bis wife\nted at bim with the lovelight in her\neyes.\n\"Dearest,\" be exclaimed suddenly as he\nwithdrew with her for a moment to a cor\nner of the apartment whioh overlooked the\ngarden with its winding paths, from which\nstrains of music arose, inviting all to the\ndanoe; \"dearest, I must leave thee now.\"\n\"UU, Abner,\" the bride half sobbed in\nreply, \"wouldst thou leave me at this mo\nment of all moments in the world? Whv.\nthe echoes of tho marriage blessings still\nresound in the air. Whither wouldst thou\ngo, dearestf Surely,\" she added, with a\nlook of reproach, \"thy place is now at my\nside. Wouldst thou forsake me on our\nwedding dayf\"\nAay, my beloved; make no close in\nquiry, nor seek to restrain me. I must go.\nI have sworn to go. Only tiust in me and\ndoubt not my faithfulness. I shall return\nwithin an hour, and then explain all to\ntbee. Have no fear for my sake.\" And\nwithout further farewell than aaulok em-\nbraoe Abner left iter and hurried into the\nopen air before the astonished guests could\nrealize tbat the bridegroom was missing.\nOf all the youth in Jerusalem Abner\nand Caleb were the comeliest lads, and\ntheir friendship bad grown into a Drover b.\nClose companions at school from boyhood\nto eany monnooa, no love could have been\nmore tender, no sympathy more profound,\nMan tunc which made them kindred snir-\nits. They were fond of the same pleasures,\nthey shared the same dreams, their studies\nand occupations were alike, their aspira\ntions identical, They loved to give free\nrein to their fancies with youth's rapt en\nthusiasm and build such dream nalaoes\ntbat the maglo splendor of Solomon 'sorea-\ntions paled in comparison. What a daring\narchitect is youth I It knows not the im\npossible. It bridges the chasm of infinite\ntime. It rears a structure to the hluhest\nneaven. is summons to its aid principal\nities and poweis, and never acknowledges\ndefeat. Love and bone and faith are the\npatient genii who at its exultant bidding\ncransiorm earcn ana sky.\nAmong the topics which Abner and\nCaleb were fond of disoussing as tbey\ngrew to maturity the future life aud im\nmortality appealed to tbem most strongly.\nThe fact that it was but dimly foreshad\nowed in the law and the prophets added\nto its fascination, and tho rare references\nto it in the debates of the schools only in\ncreased its hold upon them. One day in\nthe heat of their arguments Caleb, more\nimpassioned than usual, bad seized bis\ncompanion s band.\nAbner, be exolaiined, \"wouldst thou\nKnow the seorets of eternal life!\"'\n\"Why, Caleb,\" Abner rejoined, moved\nby his friend's earnestness, \"what a\nstrange question to ask? How can we\nmortals understand aught of immortality?\nDoes not our law say that 'the secret\nthings belong to the Lord.' \"\n\"Faith can pierce all barriers, dear\nfriend,\" Caleb answered impressively,\n\"and love, though buried from sight, can\nmake its own revelation.\"\n\"What doBt thou mean, Caleb, by those\nmysterious words and thrilling tones?\"\nAbner inquired, deeply stirred, for he felt\nthat never before bad their conversation\nbeen so earnest\n\"Dost thou not believe, Abner, in im\nmortality?\" \"Surely, Caleb, I do, as the central con\nviotion of my nature.\"\n\"If this is tby belief, then, may not the\nimmortal spirit seek converse with mor\ntality and minister to the wants and de\nsires of mortal flesh on earth?\"\n\"Caleb, tbou shouldst not speak inthls\nstrain. It is almost blasphemy. Think\nof the fate of . the sons of Aaron who\nbrought strange fire into the sanotuary I\"\n\"May, Abner, I am guilty of no blas\nphemy. I am convinced that those who\npass from life do not become as petrified\nas tbe slabs that cover them. They hover\nround those who loved them and whom\nthey loved on earth and mingle in their\njoys and sorrows. \"\n\"It must be so, Caleb, if thou thlnkest\nso,\" said Abner after a pause.\n\"Come, Abner,\" Caleb solemnly ex\nclaimed, \"let us swear by the eternal that\nif either of us die the survivor shall seek\nto communicate with the departed one and\nvisit the sepulcher at the moment of bis\nhighest happiness on earth. Then it is my\nfervent belief that the secret of heavenly\nhappiness will be unfolded, and we shall\nattain the highest degree of Intelligence:\"\nThe compact was made an unusual\nthing in those days among the pious Jew\nish youth and the conversation ended.\nIn a few years Caleb died, and Abner, dls\noonsolato and dejected, disdained for\nwhile all society, but spent the largest\nshare of his leisure at the friend's grave,\nreflecting on his genial traits and their\nloving Intercourse. Time, however, works\nIts magloal changes, and now he had mar\nried. \"I had almost forgotten thee, beloved\nuaieu, saiu Diier soiuy to Himself as\nho left tho crowded strcots of Jerusalem\nand gained the roadway leading to the\ncemetery, \"huroly this is tho huppiest\nmoinont of my life, wedded to the one I\nhold most dear. Could there be a more\nfitting time to think of thee and our mu\ntutil oat hi\nlt did not take Ions, for the distance\nwas short and ha walked with hurried\nsteps, before Abner found himself close to\nthe simple slab that covered the remains\nof Caleb. Flinging himself upon it, he\ngave way to his emotion, but by a strong\neffort his self control gained the mastery,\nThen he communed thus with the spirit of\nbis friend:\n\"Beloved Caleb, notwith fear and treni\nbling but with glad confidence I approach\nthee. Thou rememberu6t our oath.\nhave come to thy grave at the full tide of\nmy happiness, to learn of thy experience\nin the realms of bliss. Thou recallest our\nconverse in those joyous days of youth\nwhen it was our desire to pierce all mys\ntery. Be near to me now, dear friend,\nand in thy purified state uplift the veil\nwhich hides tho mortal from the immortal.\nInspire me now, oh, Caleb, with the knowl\nedge I seek and let me not ask in vain.\"\nAbner ceased, half expectant of some re\nepon Be. But no voice broke tbe stillness.\nThe shadows of evening were deepening.\nOne by one the stars shone in tbe firma\nment. Abner failed to notice the advanc\ning night in his rapt contemplation. Then\nA faint murmuring rent tbe air and tho\ntreeH that skirted the burial ground seemed\nto give forth a sobbing sound.\n\"Oh, Caleb,\" Abner entreated, without-\nstretched hands, \"answer me. By the in\neffable name of God, answer me.\"\nThe tremulous weeping of a child was\nborne on the breeze. A flash of lightning\nlit up the distant hills, and a rumbling as\nof thunder was beard.\n\"Do I disturb thee, oh, Caleb, from thy\nrest? Forgive me, beloved friend. But\nanswer me, as thou didst swear to do.\nTell me the delights of immortal life.\n\"Abner! Abnerl\" At the words Abnor's\ncountenance shone with sudden joy. \"At\nlast I\" he exclaimed. \"At last 1 hear thy\nvoice again l\"\n\"Abner, such a delight is mine as is\ncomparable to no earthly bliss. So pure,\nso radiant, so serene, are my companions\nthat my voice cannot describee thousandth\nportion of my happiness. Have no regret\nat our severed friendship. A sweeter.\nstronger bond unites us now. Dost thou\nyearn to see again my features and olasp\nmy hand as of old? Why, I am nearer to\nthee than in the past, end my eye sees\nclearer within where spirit responds to\nspirit and all is at perfect peace. I have\nsolved the mystery. I have gained the\nheights.\"\nThe voice ceased for a moment and then\nit resumed:\n\"More could I toll thee. But dost thou\nknow the penalty? A thousand years on\nearth are but as a moment in eternity.\nEven as thou oommunest with me here,\nbeloved friend, the years vanish and life\nrecedes. Oh, hasten, hasten, ere It be too\nlate I Thy bride awaits thee and wonders\nwhy thou art tarrying. Wouldst thou\nlearn tbe secret of eternal life? Make thy\nearth a heaven and live well tby mortal\nyears, with their alternate sunshine and\nshade, as best preparation for Immortality.\nauc nascen, hasten I 1 dare speak no more.\nfor thine own dear sake.\"\nAgain a child's tremulous wail was\nborne to Abner's ear. There oame a flash\nof lightning and the muttering of thunder.\nThen the shadows lifted, and it was sun\nrise on earth, with a fresh, cheerful air\nsweeping across the hills.\n\"Why, l have been sleeping,\" Abner ex-\nclaimed, rising with difficulty from the\nground. \"How careless on my parti My\nlimbs are as stiff as an old man's and mv\nshaggy beard has grown uvornlght. A\npretty figure to meet my br'de!\" he mut\ntered as he moved with hesitating steps\ntoward Jerusalem. He gained the old\nroadway, although its lines bad changed.\nHe did not recognize tbe fields in which\nsome peasants were plowing, while on ev\nery side were scattered debris and heaps\nof stone.\n\"Almighty I\" he entreated as he strained\nbis sight for tbe accustomed glory of the\ntemple mount. \"Where art thou vanished,\nO Jerusalem? 0 beloved bride, shall I sue\nthee no more? Home, friends, country,\nhave I lost ye all?\"\nAbner bad dreamed 70 years, and when\nthe dream oloud had lifted bride and\nfriends bad long since died. The temple\nhad fallen and Jerusalem had become a\nruin the spoil of triumphant Borne.\nIn seeking to pierce the mysteries of the I\nfuture, the present had passed from viow\nand left Abner In solitude. That was the\npenalty of seeing visions.

Half a dozen times she triod to\nengage the attention of the saleswoman,\nwho had enough customers waiting to\nhave occupied five saleswomen.

Thou\nsands of peo\nple who are now in their graves would be\nalive and well to-day if they had heeded\nthe first warnings of those troubles which\nlead to consumption and death.\nThe hacking cough, spitting of blood,\nweak lungs, and all similar troubles of the\norgans of breathing, will surely lead to\nconsumption, if they are not already the\nsigns of it. Then there are the other indi\ncations of the approach of consumption,\nsuch as night-sweats, emaciation, or wast\ning away of flesh from bad nutrition, which,\nif neglected, lead to certain death.\nNinety-eight per cent, of all the cases of\nweak lungs, bleeding lungs, lingering and\nobstinate coughs, and other bronchial and\nthroat diseases, which have been treated\nwith Dr. Pierce's Golden Medical Discov\nery, have been cured by it. Do not wait\nuntil your throat trouble becomes serious.\nAll bronchial and throat troubles are seri\nous. The time to take the \" Golden Medi\ncal Discovery \" is right at the start.\nEven if your throat trouble has been\nneglected until it has been pronounced\npulmonary disease or consumption, do not\nhesitate to use the \"Gulden Medical Dis\ncovery,\" for thousands of letters from the\nsufferers themselves, who are now well,\nbear evidence that the \"Golden Medical\nDiscovery\" will cure, even after good phy\nsicians have pronounced the disease pul\nmonary consumption.\n\" I had lwen troubled with bronchitis for sev\neral years,\" writes Mrs. Orliu O'Hara, Box 114,\nFergus Falls, Ottertail Co., Minn. \"In the first\nplace, I had sore throat. I doctored with differ\nent physicians and took various medicines, but\ngot no relief. I raised from my throat a sticky\nsubstance like the white of an egg. Could not\nsleep, and had made up my mind that 1 would\nnot live through the winter. I took Dr. Pierce's\nGolden Medical Discovery and ' Favorite pre\nscription ' alternately, aud\" in a few days began\nto see that I was better. I took eight bottles. I\nhave not felt as welt in years us since using\nthese medicines.\"\nUnfailable Dr. Pierce's Pleasant Pellets\nfor constipation and biliousness. .\nGeneral Grant's Characteristics.\nHe was possessed of a moral and phys\nical courage which was equal to every\nemergency in which ho was placed. He\nwas calm amid excitement, patient un\nder trials, sure in judgment, clear in\nforesight, never depressed by reverses\nor unduly elated by success. He was\nfruitful in expedients and had a facility\nof resource aud a faculty of adaptiue\nthe means at hand to the accomplish\nment of an end which never failed him.\nHe possessed an intuitive knowledge of\ntopography, which prevented him from\never becoming confused as to locality\nor direction in conducting even the most\ncomplicated movements in the field.\nHis singular self reliance enabled him\nat critical junctures to decide instantly\nquestions of vital moment without dan\ngerous delay in seeking advice from oth\ners and to assume the gravest responsi\nbilities without asking any one to share\nthem.\nHis habits of life were simple, and\nhe enjoyed a physical constitution\nwhich enabled him to endure every\nform of fatigue and privation incident\nto military service in the field. His sol\ndiers always knew that he was ready\nto rough it with them and share their\nhardships on the march. He wore uo\nbetter . clothes than they, and often ate\nno better food. There was nothing in\nhis manner to suggest that there was\nany gulf between him and the men who\nwere winning his victories. He never\ntired of giving unstinted praise to his\nsubordinates. He was at all times loyal\nto them. His fidelity produced a recip\nrocal effect aud is one of the chief rea\nsons why they became so loyally at\ntached to him. He was never betrayed\nby success into boasting of his triumphs.\nHe never underrated himself in a bat\ntle ; he never overrated himself in a re\nportGeneral Horace Porter in Cen\ntury. Archeology and the Bible.\nOriental archaeology affords us a test\nand a measure for Old Testament his\ntory; it is not a substitute for it. There\nare large portions of Old Testament his\ntory which can only be illustrated by\narchaeological research not covered by\nit portions which from the necessity\nof the case do not admit of monumental\nconfirmation. The scenes of home life\nin the history of the patriarchs, for ex\nample, can never be the subject of un\ninscription. All the archaeologists can\ndo is to illustrate them from the life of\nother orientals and to show that they\ncontain nothing which is inconsistent\nwith either history or geography. So,\nagain, the wanderings of the Israelites\nin the desert are not likely to be record\ned on the monuments of the past, but\nit can be shown that these wanderings\nare the necessary interlude between the\nexodus from Egypt and the conquest\nof Canaan and that for both the latter\nevents there is sufficient archaeological\ntestimony. Archseology is the hand\nmaid of the Bible, not its substitute.\nProfessor Sayre in Homiletio Review.\nHer State of Mind.\n\"I shall be real angry if you don't\nstop,\" she declared.\n\"And if I do stop?\" he inquired after\nkissing her again.\n\"Then I shall be mad, \" she declared,\nas she nestled down oloser to him.\nNew York Journal.\nSpeculative Philosophy.\nI.FM\nEthel Mamma, wouldn't ha be tall\nif they'd roll him out?

Everybody in\nthe settlement knew it. Jim was a no\n'count sort of a fellow, aud the old man\nwas unxious to get rid of him, so when\nthe war broke out aud they were look- I\ning around tor men the old man gave\nhim away. \"\n\"Gave him away?\"\n\"Yes. Jim was in the hayloft, and\nthey were about to leave without him\nwhen tbe old man winked and pointed\nto the bam.\n\"That was enough, and they got him\nand marched him to the front.\n\"The old man was sorry after Jim\nwas gone, and his conscience hurt him\nbad. But he honed for the hest. nntil\none day he got a message that told him\nJim had been killed and buried on the\nbattlefield.\n\"Thou, he packed his grip and started\nright oil to bring Jim's body home, if\npossible, for the grief stricken mother\nwould have nothing else, and made life\nmiserable for him with her reproaches.\n\"He went to Virginia and was there\ninformed that it would be impossible to\nremove the body. So he stood over the\nspot where it was buried and wept for\nthree days. Then he went sadly home.\n\"And, lo and behold I The first man\nhe met as he nearod his gate was Jim\nsafe, sound and right side up with caret\n\"It was some time before the old man\ncould say a word, but when he found it\nwas really Jim in flesh and blood\ntbat tbey had got him mixed up with\nsome other Adkins, aud be hadn't been\nkilled at all, the old man was hot I He\nslowly divested himself of his coat;\nthen rolled up his sleeves and made for\nhim. It was tbe liveliest scrap you ever\nsaw the old man on top, and the two\nof 'em wallowing in the dust I\n\"It took the old lady and the three\ngirls aud two stout niggers to pull the\nold man off.\n\"He never did explain why he did it,\nand Jim didn't ask any questions. But\ntbe next morning he told his mother\nthat while his furlough wasu'tout, still\nhe knew his country needed him, and\nhe couldn't stand to stay at home under\nthose ciroum stances. So he left his\nblessing for the old man and took the\nfirst train for the front.\" Atlanta\nConstitution,\nSuch a Disappointment!\n\"I came in to offer yon some\nfine spring\"\nvery\n\"Come right in,\" exolaiined the ed\nltor of the Clarion. \"Come in and sit\ndown.

Hut\nthe gTeat wish of the nobility to make\nthe empire independent of foreign man\nufacturers in case of war has led to\nlarge sums of money being expended in\nopening up the mining districts.\nThe criminal statistics of New\nSouth Wales show that of 3S.0O0 crimi\nnals arrested in 1800, 19,000 were \"Brit\nishers' and 15,000 Australians. Of this\nnumber 8.700 of the English were ar\nrested for drunkenness, while only 3.900\nAustralians were arrested on a similar\ncharge. I n cases of assault and robbery\nwith violence there were 1.149 Austra\nlians arrested and 778 Englishmen.\nThe Tansa water-works for the\nsupply of Ilombav were only completed\naftsr very great physical difficulties\nhad been overcome. The work involved\nthe construction of a masonry dam two\nmiles long to form a lake of nearly six\nsquare miles in area. There are fifty\nfive miles of ducts, twenty -seven miles\nof iron mains, four miles of tunnel and\nnearly a mile of iron girder bridges.\nOne of the \"finds\" frequently made\nin old curiosity shops on the continent,\nand particularly in Paris, is the cross of\nthe Mexican order created by the ill\nfated Maximilian. As for the insignia\nof Isabella the Catholic, that decora\ntion and the military orders created by\nher father Cjueen Isabella bestowed so\ngenerously that many unworthy peo\nple had them, and the lavish bestowal\nof them suggested the libretto of \"La\nGrande Duchesse.\"\nThe ladies of high caste who live in\nXair, Malabar, have been prohibited by\ntime-honored usage from crossing the\nKarapoya river, which divides the prov\nince into two parts. It has just oc\ncurred to the more enlightened natives\nthat this relic of the dark ages has exist\ned long enough, and an attempt is now\nleing made to do away with the sense\nless custom. The Xair ladies are deliirht\nedat the prospect that lief ore long they\nwill tie able to go wherever they please\nin their native country.\nAt the felling of an ancient hollow\noak in a (lerman forest when the tree\ncrashed to the ground it disclosed a\nhuman skeleton in excellent preserva\ntion. From his long lxxts powder\nflask and other articles found he ap\npeared to have been a hunter, and it\nwas concluded that the unfortunate\nman. in climbing the tree in pursuit of\nsome wounded animal or bird, had\nslipped into the hollow trunk, had been\nunable to extract himself, and so had\nperished miserably of starvation in h is\nready-prepared oak coffin.\nMarius was the first Roman to wear\na gold ring, and no one, unless he had\nbeen an ambassador, could wear one\nexcept on state occasions. Gradually\nthe ring came to lie the badge of knight\nhood, and finally all restrictions as to\nits being worn were cast aside and the\nring was adopted generally as an orna\nment. The Roman \"dudes\" finally be\nep, me so enamored of their rings that\nthey put fr.e on every joint of both\nhands. Then they had \"weekly\" rings\nanil summer and winter rings, and\nsome never wore the same ring twice.\nTHE ENDS OF CREATION.\nTwo Town Which Mark the Extreme\nNorth and South.\nDo yo'.i know the names of the two\ntowns that respectively are the north\nernmost and most southerly in the\nworld? Thev are Hammerfest. Norway,\nand Punta Arenas. ChilL The former\nis the capital of Finmark, the extensive\nprovince or annex of Norway, which\nforms the extreme northern portion of\ncontinental Europe, and is situated be\ntween the Arctic sea and Russian Lap\nland. Finmark has an area of 18,300\nsquare miles, includes Norwegian Lap\nland and comprises numerous islands.\nthe northernmost of which is North\ncape. It has important fisheries, which\npive emn'oyment to the greater part of\na population of nearly 25,000.\nHain.nerfest is the Qual-oe (Whale\nisland), of which it is the chief port,\nand is sixty miles southwest of North\ncape. Its houses are of wood, and\nare painted on the outside. Communi\ncation between its quarters is kept up\nby boats. Its harbor is defended by a\nfort.\nAlthough situated in latitude 70 deg.\n40 min. 7 see. north, the summer heat\nat times is oppressive, and even\nthroughout the winter the tempera\nture is mild enough for fishing to\" be\ncarried on. The sun stays two months\nabove its horrizon. The town exports\nstockfish, whale, seal and fishoil, skins,\nwalrus hides, teeth, copper, and feath\ners. Its population is about 2.100. In its\ntrade Norwegian, English, German and\nKussian vessels are engaged. Thirty\nemail vessels are sent out early in the\nspring to Spitzbergen to take part in\nthe fisheries and walrus hunting. Train\nand codlivcr oil are manufactured in\nHammerfest. Salted fish is the princi\npal export.\nOn Funginass, or Bird's cape, which\nprotects the harbor on the north,\nstands a column, with an inscription\nin Norse and Latin, stating that the\ntown was the destination of the ex\npedition for the measurement of the\narc of meridian. It was also the place\nchosen by Capt. Sabine for the scene of\nhis pendulum experiments.\nPunta Arenas is Spanish for Sandy\nFeint- It is situated upon a level plain\nin the Chilian colony of Magellanes.\nand on the east coast of the Brunswick\npeninsula. Back of the town snow\ncapped mountains rise to the height of\none thousand feet\nIts houses are almost all one story,\nand built irregularly. Just outside the\nsettlement are fields of moss and low\nhills whose timber has been burned.\nOpposite the point, on the other side of\nthe straits of Magellan, is the island of\nTerra del Fuego. the Land of Fire, so\nMyled by Magalnaens, its Portuguese\ndiscoverer, because of the great number\nof fires which he noticed upon it the\nfirst night he approached its shore.\nPunta Arenas was founded in 1S43 as\na penal settlement, and has ever since\nbeen known as such to those who have\nread or heard of it. Its unenviable\nreputation led to its decline in popula\ntion until the European steamship lines\nadopted the route through the straits\nto the west coast of South America.\nThen the town was nsed as a station\nof call and supply, and in 1868 Chili\nsent out SO0 immigrant, with a gov\nernor, to take possession of it. The\nimmigrants brought along with them\nwood for building purposes, and sup\nplies to last until the lend granted them\nhad been cleared and cultivated.\nThen thesendiDgof the convicts there\nwas stopped. The military guard was\nwithdrawn during the war with Peru,\n; and the prisoners who consented to\njoin the army pot a ticket rf leave.\nFrom 1S0S to 1S the ppalation of the\ntown increased from \"00 to 2.000.\nThe soil is good, coal mines abound\nand gold and silver abound. The coal\nmines are worked bv a company, which\nnavs the Chilian crovernment a small\n! tax for the privilege. A tramway\nbrings to town the coal, which is con\nsidered a good \"steam\" article.\nFormerly steamers had to go to the\nFalkland islands five hundred miles\ndistant, to get their supplies. Now\nthey find them at Punta Arenas. The\ncrop of potatoes is considerable, cattle\nthrive, mushrooms are obtainable in\nlarge quantities, and in the various\nseasons parrots, geese, ducks, snipe,\nwood peckers, ibis and other birds are\nfound.\nJunta Arenas is the largest town in\nsouthernmost Chili, ami the only one in\nthe strait. From the nearest settl\nment on the Chilian coast to the first\none on the eastern side is a distance of\nabout four thousand miles, and the voy\nage lasts from fifteen to sixteen days,\nand Punta Arenas is the only stopping\nplace.\nThe population is of the most varied\nkind, including ex-convicts, fugitives of\nall sorts, castaway sailors, desert\ners from the navies of all coun\ntries. Chinamen, negroes. I'olanders,\nIrish. English, Italians, Germans, Rus\nsians, Portuguese. Spaniards. Hebrews\nmen from all climes, types of humani\nty. Every tongue seems to lie spoken,\nand each language seems to have its\ninterpreter. English largely predomi\nnates.

Cape Horn agates, turtle shells,\narmadillo tails, in which the Patago\nnians carry their war paint: guanaeo,\nseal and ostrich skins and ostrich rugs.\nThe last named are made from the\nbreasts of young ostriches, and arc of\nsoftest down and Liveliest plumage.\nThe plumes are plucked from the birds\"\ntails and wings while alive, but to ob\ntain the rugs the little ostriches are\nkilled and skinned. Then the breasts\nare sewed together. Different colors\nare artistically blended. The rugs are\nused for carriage robes, for the backs\nof couches or chairs, for panels in front\nof dress skirts, and for opera cloaks.\nCincinnati Commercial Gazette.\nNORSE POND.\nA Curious Lake That va In!T by the An\ncient Norsemen.\nA friend of the \"Listener.\" who has\nbeen down on the coast of Maine, is\nmuch excitv'd over the discovery there\nof a lake which is evidently of artificial\nconstruction, and the building of which\nhe can refer to no other architects than\nthe Norsemen, who must have con\nstructed it nearly five centuries before\nthe \"landing\"\" of Columbus. The \"Lis\ntener's\" friend does not. indeed, claim\nto have discovered the lake. It already\nln-ars the name of Norse pond, and has\nattracted the attention cf the ol!icers of\nthe United States coast survey: but the\ndescription of it which these officers\nemiKxlied in their recent annual report\nis the only printed account of it which\nhas ever been published, and that is by\nno means exhaustive. It is compara\ntively an unknown wonder. This is the\nway the \" Listeners' friend tells the\nstory of the pond:\n\"It is located in the quaint and charm\ningly picturesque town of Cutler, on\nthe far toast of Maine, between Machias\nand Eastport. and may well invite the\ninvestigation of those among us who\nare interested in our antiquities. The\nvillage of Cutler has lieen built around\na beautiful and deep inlet known to\nsailors as Little River harlior. The\ntownship of Cutler is not confined to\nthe immediate vicinity of Little River\nharlior. but reaches for several miles\nalong the coast in either direction and\nextends far into the interior. Four\nmiles to the northeast of the village of\nCutler is a tranquil sheet of the purest\nfrcfA water, consisting of about eighty\nacres, which at certain seasons of the\nyear affords excellent shelter and feed\ning ground for large numbers of water\nfowl a veritable sportsman's paradise.\n\"This is Norse pond; between it and\nthe ocean rises a large hill or elevation,\nwhile behind is a second stretch of high\nland. The intervening space forms the\nlied of the pond. Human hands at some\nearly period converted this inter-vale\ninto an artificial body of fresh water\nby damming up a brook which flowed\nthrough it. A massive wall of over a\nthousand feet in length and of varying\nthickness has been constructed across\nthe northeast extremity of this space.\nThe material consists of large and\nsmall liowlders brought from the neigh\nliorhood from quite a distance around.\nThe scarcity of small bowlders and\nstones in the neighborhood ol\nthe pond confirms this theory\nof artificial construction. Consid\nerable mechanical skill and persever\nance are displayed in this piece of\nmasonry. The query suggests itself:\nWho built this wall and thus created\nNorse pond? None of the early settlers\nof this portion of Maine did it. because\nCutler was settled bv the grandfathers\nof many now living, and no living per\nson has any authentic tradition as tc\nthe real authors of the mysterious\nstructure.\n\"The locality of Norse pond bears nc\nother evidence of early settlers, French,\nEnglish or Indians. There are no argu\nments in favor of a belief that the\naborigines designed and constructed the\nwall. It would le almost impossible to\nconceive of any necessity of their mak\ning artificial ponds if they were familiar\nwith the interior of the country, which\nis thickly covered with lakes and ponds.\nResides, the present appearance of the\npond tells a story of great age. It could\nnot have leen built within several cen\nturies. It bears every evidence of hav\ning been put together by a people more\nor less civilized. Confirmatory of the\nNorse theory is the fact that a few years\nt ago the remains of a vessel of undonbt-\nI ed Norse construction were dug out of\nthe sand near Grand Menan island, r.nd\ndirectly on the shore nearest N-rc por.d.\nWill not some one who has a special\nknowledge of archaeology tell us what\nto think about this mysterious stone\nwall?\" Boston Journal\nNeighborly Courtesies.

The\ntop of the jacket is sometimes shaped\nin square corners above the armholes,\nwith lapping stitched edges falling on a\nfull vest a very pretty fashion for bril\nliantines and polka-dotted or snowflake\nwools. Other jacket fronts are formed\nentirely of shot or wide moire sash rib\nbon over a crepon bodice, and delicate\nlace zouave fronts are on crepe de chine\ngowns; square revers or gathered jabot\nrevers edge other zouav s and entire\njackets of crepon are worn over blouse\nbodices of\nIndia silk; an\nother fancy,\nconsidered ex\ntremely styl\nish, is that of\nputting a vest\nof black raous\nseline de soie\nin wool gowns\nof very light\ncolors. Thus,\na Newport\ndress of pink\nish mauve cre\npon has a\nround bodice\nwith short\nfigaro front is\nturned back in\nlittle revers\nfrom a full\ngathered vest\nof black silk\nmuslin. This\nvest is set under a short square yoke\nand collar of ecru Irish guipure laee,\nand is gathered at the waist line under\na girdle of the lace which is quite nar\nrow there, but widens gradually on the\nsides to form a broad corselet in the\nback. A little coat frill of the lace is\nset on just ii the middle of the back.\nThe high collar is a straight puff of the\nsilk muslin, with a bit of the iaee above\nit. The skirt has a bias seam down the\nback, and is demi-trained. A lovely\nhouse gown of yellow crepon, with de\nsign woven in bay adere stripes, has a\nsimilar vest erf black chiffon, with yoke\ncorselet, and collar of white lace stud\nded with cut jet cabochons.\nA new chiffon almost as thick as\ncrape is a popular fabric much in us\nfor snowv white ry tg\ngowns for danc\ning and brides\nmaids' dresses.\nAlpaca is also\npopular once\nagain, and de\nsigners across\nthe water have\nmade up this fab\nric this summer,\nin combination\nwith moss green\nor golden brown\nvelvet. Among\nwatering place\ntailor gowns for\nafternoon, that\nare w o r n this\nseason, are those\nof sea-gray Eng\nlish serge, with\ntrailing princess\"\nbacks, and coat\nfronts of pood\nlength, opening over vests of lustrous\nfaiile silk, or shot and dotted surah.\nWhite cloth gowns in the same style\nare trimmed with silk braid dotted with\ngold, with white surah silk vest show- I\ning petit pois dots of gold. To complete\nthis for a visiting dress, a large white\nhat is almost covered with white and\nyellow roses, with large loops of wired\nlace in the center of the crown, a length\nof yellow velvet ribbon showing\nthrough the middle of each loop.\nReally beautiful tailor-made ging\nhams and zephyrs are trimmed with\nvelvet ribbon and velvet buttons, and\nanother caprice is that of using silk\nruches at the foot of French gingham\ngowns,\nfancy for\nThe\ntailor\nhas\nstyles\nspread to quite\nthin faCricS,not-\nably to the bat\nistes, of silk and\nlinen that have\nbeen sold this\nseason in dark\nshades of blue\nwith white\nstripes, and also\nin cross-bars of\nthese colors. A\nblue silk lining\nis used for these\ndresses, the\nstriped skirt is\nbias at the back\nand has gored\nfront and side\nbreadths, and\nthe suit is com\npleted by a styl\nish French coat bodice which opens in\nfront to show a white waistcoat, or\na blouse of white silk sprigged with\nblue.\nPrincess effects are still very muoh\nthe rage.\nDark blue in cheviot, storm serge and\nFrench camel's hair will be a fashion\nable utility fabric for autumn tailor\ngowns.

Several es\ntablishments were put in operation,\nand farmers all over the state were in\nquiring as to tne necessary machinery,\ncost cf operation, methods, etc.\nThe process is so simple and the\nmechanism so inexpensive that there is\nnothing to prevent potato growers all\nover the state who are threatened with\na surplus from engaging in the making\nof starch. The New England Home\nstead gives a short account of the oper\nation, and it is reproduced here for the\nbenefit of readers who may be disposed\nto engage in the industry. A wire bas-\nC\nket to wash the tubers, a rotary rasp\ning machine, a few large tubs or water\ntight hogsheads, some wire and hair\ncloth sieves and a drying-room com\nprise the principal pieces.\nA simple rasping machine is cbovrn\nin figure 1, and consists of a band\nwheel (A), over the rim of which has\nbeen secured, rough side out, a piece of\nsheet iron previously roughened up\nlike a nutmeg grater by punching it\nfull of holes. The wheel is mounted on\nan axle supported by the wooden\nframe so as to revolve immediately be\nneath the mouth of a metal-liaed\nwooden hoprer (H).\nA more effective ra?per or grinder is\nshown in figure It consists of a\ncylinder (C) twenty inches in diameter\nand two feet long, mounted on an axis.\nIt is armed with steel saw plates,\nplaced about three-quarters of an inch\napart, parallel with the cylinder and\nhaving small and regular teeth. The\nplates are held in position by iron\nclamps, so that the toothed edges pro\nject about four-fifths of an inch from\ntne periphery of the drum. It is driven\nat the rate of about eight hundred revo\nlutions per minute before the hopper\nand is capable of pulping about forty\neight bushels of potatoes an hour. In\nboth these machines the rasping sur\nfaces are kept clean by the action of\nsmall jets of water projected with\nsome force.\nAs the washed potatoes are passed\nthrough one of these machines, the\npulp and wash water are run off into\ntubs, and after the coarser particles\nhave been deposited, the milky liquid is\ndrawn off into other tubs, and the\nstarchy matter allowed to settle; er, as\nin large factories, the pulp may be\nrubbed and washed through a series of\nsieves, ranging from coarse wire gauze\nto fine haircloth. After repeated wash\nings with fresh water in the tubs, to\nseparate the gummy and fibrous mat\nters, the starch crannies are finallv al-\nj iowe(i to settle, and after the water has\nlw,n ,)r9,vn ff tlw nntr- mass nt\nstarch and water is run off into long\nwooden troughs, slightly inclined,\nwherein the paste gradually hardens as\nthe water drains off. When hard\nenough, it is cut into blocks and put on\nshelves in a warm room to dry out.\nWith good management, from seven\nteen pounds to eighteen pounds of clear\nstarch can be obtained by these simple\nmeans from 100 pounds of average po\ntatoes. SHEEP SHEARINGS.\nTen good sheep are better than thirty\npoor ones.\nDo not \"attempt to keep too many\nsheep on the pasture.\nDoes warm weather favor the growth\nof wool? asks an inquirer. Certainly.\nWool, when first taken from the\nsheep looks better and weighs heavier\nthan it ever will afterwards.\nIs England the flockmasters change\nthe feed of the flock quite often, and\neven change the pastures.\nThe flock that is regularly fed and\nwatered and properly housed from\nstorms will produce the best fleeces.\nThere is no call in the market for\nthin sheep or lambs. At least the call\nis not very loud, not loud enough to in\ndicate profit.\nTimothy hav for sheep is like a fence\nrail as compared to clover. Besides if\nit is not cut until the straw becomes\nripe it is dangerous to lambs.\nWill not the production of good mut\nton be over done? asks a correspon\ndent. Not in your life, friend, and we\nhave not the slightest idea how young\nyou are either.\nWe may produce the best fleece that\never grew on a slieep s oac, but ii\nwe handle the wool carelessly, an in\nferior wool that is better handled will\nbring a better price than ours. Farm\ners' Voice.\nItroken Flint as Grit.\nHard flint, crushed or ground, will\nsome day be placed on the market for\nthe use of pouitrymen in providing grit\nfor fowls. It is true that nearly all\nsections have gravel, but gravel is worn\nby the elements into round shapes, or\nrather the sharp edges are taken off.\nThe object in swallowing hard sub\nstances by the fowls is to secure sharp\ncutting material- and ordinary gTatel\ndoes not supply their wants. Many\npersons use oyster shells, reduced by\ngrinding or pounding, but shells are too\nsoft and do not fully serve the purpose\nrequired. Flint is the best material, as\nit always presents sharp edges, no mat\nter how fine it may be in condition.\nFarm and Fireside.\nIlk\nPEN POINTS.\nHeixo, Cnossox!

Webb, Mrs. Town\nsend Harden.iwl a lot of other equally\nfashii liable women are iUspousoru.and\nthat is as much as saying that it has\ncome to stay, at least until some other\nreplaces it.\nThis new way of greeting, of panto\nmiming, such thoughts as \"Delighted\nto see you!\" Here's that bore again,\"\netc., is an allegro movement, and if the\ntime it should consume in execution\ncould be measured by a metronome it\nwould be marked \"200.\"\nIt is a triple expansion sort of shake,\nIt begins on the left side,glides over to\nthe right, and from time to time it\nambles back on the same line to its\noriginal position twice, all in the brief\nspace of exactly one second by the\nwatch. The more this record is re\u00ad\nduced the higher up the shake is in the\nsocial scale: his or her status is regulat\u00ad\ned by the rapidity of the movement of\nthe forearm.\nSOCIETY'S L.ATEST HANLSHAKE.\nThis, at the horse show, was held at\nan angle of 33 degrees,the elbow locked\nto the waist, the knuckle of the hand\na quarter of an inch below the chin\nand an inch to the left of the center of\nthis. Then madame bends her fingers\nuntil they assume the slant of the slop\u00ad\ning roof of a Long Island barn, and\nholds them rigidly in that position.\nSimultaneously with this act of con\u00ad\ndescension on her part the man who is\nprivileged to touch these jeweled digits\ncopies her, only upside down that is,\nthe barn roof position of his hand is in\u00ad\nverted, made into a sort of trench, into\nwhich her hand slips.\nAll this, of course, to the learned in\nthe new shaking art is done as quick as\na wink. No special amount of skill is\nneeded for its accomplishment, but\nwhat follows is where the fine work\n'comes in. No sooner does madame's\nfingers touch those of monsieur than a\npresto galop step is made by both of\ntheir hands at once, four jerky glide*\nwithout stopping to right, then to\nleft, back again to right, then to start\u00ad\ning point, where they automatically\npart company with greatest alacrity,as\nthough no further acquaintance was\ndesirable.\nThe less rhythmic this shake the\nquicker it is done and the more dis\njointedly the sooner may one hope for\nsocial recognition, the sooner may one\nhope to be received into the blissful\nMOVEMENTS OF THE HANDSHAKE,\npasturage of the \"400,\" where the ex\u00ad\nclusive lambs of Shepherd McAllister\ngraze and bask and frisk about.\nAn impecunious swell was overheard\nto say at the show that selling bonnets,\nflowers, or notepaper did not offer half\nthe alluring prospects for filling one's\npockets as a class for learning the ap\u00ad\nproved shake.

This we know is\nnot true.\nThe opening of the storehouse of\nEgyptian archaeology has taught us\nthat many supposed to be new things\nare^oldir than the hills\" of some\nplaces. Ball playing is one of these\nthings.\nThe Esrvotians left us no nrinted\nbooks and but few papyri manuscripts,\nbut the climate of the Nile country, has\nproven a good. preservative of relies\nand has held for us the stories chiselled\nin stone. Some of these stories tell us\nof ball games.\nAGAINST THE HOLES.\nAway back in the twelfth Egyptian\ndynasty, four thousand years ago. a\nCoptic artist sculptured on the walls of\nthe temple lieni Hassan human figures\ntossing balls and in the attitude of re\u00ad\nceiving and of having pitched a ball.\nTo the modern baseball lover some of\nthese figures are interesting studies'\nDid you ever closely observe the con\u00ad\ntortions of some of the present day\ncrack pitchers when they appear to be\ntying themselves into a series of knots\nand then letting them out with a jefk,\nmaking the ball fly as though thrown\nfrom a catapult? With this picture in\nmind,look at some of the pictures from\nthe Beni Hassan temple as taken from\nSir. J. Gardiner Wilkinson's \"Manners\nand Customs of Ancient Egypt,\" and\nsee if you don't notice a similarity of.\nposition.\nThe figure with both feet ofE of the\nground represents a pitcher who has\njust delivered the ball, and he has un\u00ad\ndoubtedly violated one of the modern\npitching rules, which requires the\npitcher's feet to remain on the ground.\nLikely, the present law was not in\nforce 4,000 years ago.\nEGYPTIAN LEATHER BALL.\nFortunately for our knowledge,some\nof the actual balls used in the games\non the banks of the Nile have been dis\u00ad\ncovered after remaining hidden for\nmora than forty centuries. One, very\ninteresting from its construction, is\nnow in the British Museum. It is made\nof sewn leather and is three inches in\ndiameter.\nNo doubt when the players were\npictured on the temple walls the game\nwas quite an ancient one, for it is to be\nobserved that women play the same as\nmen. In fact, most of the placing is\npictured as being done by women. It\nis not unlikely that the men first began\nplaying bail and after many years the\nwomen became devoted to it.\nThe historian in stone does not give\nus the records of the players or the\nsalary list.\n/BUSHNELL A3 A NEWS CENTER.\nTwo irm\u00bbrs Go I^\u00bb\\v }\u00abnl Un'qii\"\nI* n* R-MIII*.\nTwo Bush'nell Illinois farmers says\nthe Cliicago Tribune are just now de\u00ad\nclaring that the laws of Illinois are de\u00ad\nfective. They do not present any argu\u00ad\nments in the case. All they do is tc\nmake the bare statement and allow\ntheir experience to go as backing.\nThese two farmers did have a. uni\u00ad\nque experience with the law's delays\nand eccentricities. They got into a\nlawsuit and neither won. IJoth lost\nand each was compelled to pay for hi?\nexperience. This was how it happen\u00ad\ned:\nThe cattle of\none\nfarmer climbed over\na fence and into the corn field of the\nother. Then the cattle ate too freely\nof the corn and died.\n\"I want my corn,\" said the farmer\nwhose fence was down.\n\"I want my cattle,\" shrieked the\nother.\nThen tliey went to law.\nA venire of talesmen as extensive as\nthat used up in the Conghlin ease was\nexhausted before six good men and\ntrue were found willing to swear to no\nprejudice or favor and try the case on\nits merits.\nI\nTHE DISPUTE ESDED IN A LAWSUIT.\nThe remarkable verdict turned np\nby these six men was to the effect that\na man who would not guard his prop\u00ad\nerty with the necessary stake and\nrider deserved to have his corn nipped,\neaten, and stolen, and, on the other\nhand,that cattle or other things caught\nbrowsing in forbidden pastures de\u00ad\nserved to suffer even if death itself be\u00ad\ncame the penalty.\nThen the court took a hand. It up\u00ad\nheld the verdict as just and according\nto the law and evidence, and at once\ncollected the costs from the .joint con\u00ad\ntribution of plaintiff and defendant.\nRusluiiore\nRATES 12.

' : .\nThere is a unity existing among men as among\ndifferent types oflanimals. If we examine him\nmorally and. intellectually, we shall at once place\nhim at the Ihead of creation. In the identity of\nmental and moral character, we find expressed the\nunitv of mankind. In these characteristics we\n\" discover that' he :s the highest development of na\nture superior to all else in the plau of creation.\nIn him, in\" these respects, we find the relation of a\ncommon brotherhood, responding to the intention\nof the Creator.\nThis is a higher unity than that of genealogy.\nvv oWil.l not love others because they are the\nsons of Adam we should not Iosp the evidence of\nbrotherhood even if it were shown that mere is\n. no common origin of the race.\n\" Those who maintain the unity of mankind have\nchiefly regarded these points, and overlooked the\nBtudy of those points suggested by his physical\npeculiarities, in which wc should naturally trace\nhis origin.\nAn original diversity of races is not alone ob\nserved in the case of man. The whole animal\ncreation evinces it. Among the most important\nproofs of this facts.too, which have been ill-appreciated\nand which if l ightly understood and traced\nup, should have led those basing their arguments\nfor an original unity upon it to directly reverse\nconclusions, are those arising from Ilybridity.\nAnimals propagate only among those of the\nsame kind. Different species will propagate mixed\nraces or half breeds, intermediate between the pa\nrents. We have a familiar example ' in .he horse\nand the ass mules are exactly intermediate be\ntween them. Now the horse and ass, though of\n\"the same family, are distinct types. Propagation\nbetween different breeds of horses produces no\ngreat diversity, and so of asses, though there\n'are very unlike breeds of both theso classes, the\noffspring of the same family are never half breeds,\ntt may resemble either parent, but will never 1 e\nmuch unlike either. If we examine among the\ndifferent races of men, we shall find the same\nfacts.\nThe progeny of every cc-gnate tribe as for in\nstance, the different white tribes may resemble\neither parent, and are never very unlike either.\nOn the contrary, the offspring of races remotely\nresembling each other, aro in the same condition\nas those of different species among animals. Th us\nthe offspring of a white and a black is never while\nor black but always a mulatto. By the laws of\nreproduction, it is shown that there is a great di\nversity between these types, as between animals of\ndistinct species.\nThe study of language has given direction to\nanother sense of investigation upon this subject.\nCommunity of origin among different languages\nhas been one of the strongest arguments for the\ncommon origin of the human race. They have\nbeen thought to depend so much one upon auoth\nlanuafi-es. Many were spoken simultaneously.\nThe oldest Chinese monuments exhibit the same\nChinese language which is spoken to-day so of\nthe ancient Egyptian, the Tlebrew, the old Greek,\nwhich presents the same-characteristics as modern\nGreek they were always within the reach of tra\ndition separate and distinct. These, cases are very\nsimilar to sets of notes characteristic of different\nfamilies of animals.\nILw theu arose languages so intimately allied,\nas for instance the Spanish and Italian ? They ev\nidently grew from an admixture a foreign infu\nsion superadded to the original stock. Modern\nmixed nationalities, are evident examples of the\nprocess.\nThe farther back Archaeology takes us, the more\ndistinct do we find the races. This branch of the\nsubioct is so familiar to this community, and has\nbeen discussed so ably here, that I need only refer j\nto the fact, tnat as far back as monuments iurmsh\nus evidence, far beyond history, we find the same\ndistinct types.\nMy own views on this subject differ widely from\nthose of others, who have before maintained an\noriginal diversity of races. In my opinicn not\noniy did different races, or types of mankind, as\nthe five races, so called, have a distinct origin but\neach distinct nationality which has played an ira\nportantpart in history, had a separate origin men\nwere created in nations.\nWe may trace in detail how far diversity is\nmanifest in eveu less prominent shades. We will\ninstance Spain on account of its isolation. A\" Greek\nwriter 700 years before Christ, spoke of the fine,\nsoft wool, brought from Spain by the Phoenicians.\nSo the horses of Spain are mentioned as dinerent\nfrom any known to the writer; doubtless the orig\ninal stock of the Andalusian horses; as the sheep\nmentioned, of the modern merino sheep. Ihese\nwere their oniy domesticated animals. I hey had\nno cattle till long after. There is no i:ention of\nwild bulls here. In Italy there was a peculiar spe\ncies of the bull the Bison at a very early period.\nThis is not however, the original of our cattle. It\nwas found in Southern Italy J and no where else.\nThe wild bull, from which sprung our stock, was\npeculiar to Central Europe and was wild in the\nforests of Germany till the 11 th century. The\nRomans used to send out bodies of men to hunt\nthese animals in the Alps of Switzerland. Ths\nUoat of Eirvpt and Palestine is xmlike our own\nin a molten, condition and gradually-cooling have\nassumed the solid form. The proof of this is am\nply furnished by geological investigations- .

The fact that be\ntween the Latin and French, and between the\nLatin and Italian especially, there is the closest\nresemblance that the Romanic is similar to the\nGermanic that Greek and Sanscrit- or these di\nalects known as the Indo-Germanic have, it is\nclaimed, so to speak, the same vocabulary that\ntheir roots can be traced to the same forms these\nfacts have been considered evidence of a transmis\nsion of language from one tribe to another, and\nthat all speaking them were related by common\ndescent, and had received them by direct tradition\nfrom these earlier common sources.\nThis I deny directly.\nThe inference is entirely unfounded ; these re\nsemblances do not show the sama origii. still less\nthat they have been derived by tradition. Eveu\nfrom researches in the animal kingdom, this posi\ntion is shown to be false. Language is to man as\nvoice to animals. To each kind there is a distinct\nclass ef sounds, characteristic of the species. As\nfor instance, birds wild and tame have a set of\nsonnds peculiar to themselves, and unlike all other\nanimals. Again, the mocking bird has its charac\nteristic voice, as all thrushes have a similar voice\nwhich distinguishes them. But the voice of a dog\nis unlike that of a tiger the dog kind all bark,\nwhile the cat kind all have a kind of mewing cry.\nSome kinds may indeed mock others, as the\nmocking-bird imitates others' notes. They have,\nhowever, each a peculiar and characteristic note ;\nso the negro in speaking English, French or Span\nish, when he has learned them, does not give their\nidiomatic accent, he utters them as his throat and\nnature have modified them.\nThere is a marked diversity between different\nspecies of animals iu this respeet. We have for\ninstance many species of the dog-family, as wolves,\nfoxesjackalhi, the bine fox of the artic regions;\nbesides, distinct species in Asia, Africa, and South\nAmerica, but they all bark. Their cries are as\ncharacteristic a3 their instincts. They all hunt,\nchase, follow their prey to death, and these intrin\nsic peculiarities are universally distinctive of the\nfamily.\nAgain of the cat kind, we have the Hon, the\ntiger, the red tiger, the puma, the wild cats, and\nmany other species, in all no less than thirty-six,\n.of different sizes, and many specific unlikcnesses ;\nduc ineir general characteristics are the same ; their\nunity is as intimate as that of dogs. They all,\nthe tiger, lion, &c, like cats, await their prey, and\nfailing to catch it by springing, do not pursue it\nlike dogs.\nThey are alike treacherous, and all mew. The\nroar of the lion, and the cry of the cat, if philo\nsophically analyzed, might show as great similarity\nas the Greek and Sanscrit. And yet the mode of\narticulation is the same in the lion and tio-er.\nSo of birds. No one. would fail to recognise\nthe wood-pecker by his note, not the drumiiiiu\"\nnoise made by pecking trees, but by his peculiar\nsong. By this alone he is easily distinguished\nfrom all other varieties of birds, though this spe\ncies is very numerous, there being no less than 12\nkinds in America ; besides different ones in Eu\nrope, Africa, &c. So the thrushes are easily known\nby their sweet song. And though they mock the\nsongs of other birds, we yet recegnizt them by\ntheir, proper voice.

The conclusion is perfectly\ngratuitous. There is not a particle of evidence to\nsustain such a gradation in a siugle instance.\nThe end towards which all these modifications of\nthe material and animal world tends, is man.\nWhile there is a complete separation . between .dif\nferent species of living beings, they have all reached\ntheir highest development in the present order of\nthings. Ihe whole process has led to tins result\nthroughout, there has been the simultaneous exist\nence of these classes, evidently planned from the\nbeginning for this end; arranged so as to find\ntheir full expression and highest type in man.\nThe question arises whether there will be further\nLprogress whether there will be another creation\naud an order of beings higher than man. In an\nimal structures, on the present plan, there seems no '\nroom tor further progress, it we examine the\nstructure of the vertebrates, we see that fishes have\nthe back in a horizontal position that the brain\nis a mere prolongation of the spinal marrow that\ntheir structure confines them to a horizontal posi\ntion, which they also keep while in motion. In\nreptiles we hud another structure ; the anterior\nlobe of the braiu is small, the middle larger. In\nbirds the middle lobe advances so as partly to cov\ner the posterior lobe. In man the hindmost lobe\nis covered by the middle one, and that bv the an\nteritr lobe. The spine is vertical, giving an erect\nposition, thus we see that in him the anterior\nlobe of the brain is most prominent, and hence\nespecially of use ; as we see from their plan that\nbirds are adapted for moving freely in the air, so\nfar there is a gradation there is no farther room\nfor enlarging on this plan.

There arc large portions of\nOld Testament history which can\nonly be illustrated by archaeologi\ncal reserch not covered by it; por\n6ions which fron the necessity of\nthe case do not admit of monumen\ntal conflrmation. The scenes of\nhome life in the history of the\nPatriarchs, for example, can never\nbe the subject of an inscription ; all\nthe archaeologists can do is to\nil lust rate themt f romt the life of\nother orientals, and to show that\nthey contain niotinug which is in\nconsistent with either history or\ngeograph)ly. So, again, the wander\nings of the Israelites iln the desert\nar0 not likely to be recorded onl the\nmonuments of the plast. But it can\nbe shown thait these wanderings\nare t.h,e nocessary interludbe between\nthe exodus from Egypt andl the coni\nquest of Canaan, and that for bothl\ntihe latter events there is sulicient\narchaeological testimony.

He plrfyed?well, no mat\nter. sufficient to say he was a member.\nIt was known, as the Swan town Cornet\nHand. That was not the name of It, but\nthat will answer as well as any in telling\nthis story. The town did not cut half the\nligure the band did?in the opinion of the\nmemltis. Some, however, who were prone\nto sneer at all attempts to step from the\nruts established by their fathers and grand\nfathers thought otherwise, and they would\nsometime- say: \"No town, no band,\" while\nthe big bass drum, with an intonation like\na. lake frog, would echo back its \"boom,\nboom.\" as if It wouM say: \"No band, no\ntown.\"\nAi <1 this band ar.d this drum advertised\nthe town. In memory the big surface of\nthe abnormal drum can now be seen, and\nui-ross its face were painted in golden let\nters these wordsV'Swantown Comet Band.\"\nThis Swuntown Cornet Hand was an or\nganization fearfully and wonderfully madf\nIt haii mmbers black and white, tall and\nfchort. rich and poor, Irish, Yankee, Dutch\n?anil others.\nWhatever called It into existence has al\nways been a mystery, but it came, saw\nami conquered. Tt was organized one win\nter's niglit a quarter century or more ago.\nar.d It prospered.\nWhen it was voted that such a thing\nshould exist within the precincts of that\nmountain hamlet, and the instruments\nbought. P'.-sslbly rot more than three oa:\nof the eighteen who were enrolled as musi\ncians hail ever seen a band Instrument.\nBorne did not know an E-llat eornet from a\nstove hook. Possibly they could have\npicked cut the stove hook, but would net\nhave known what the other thing was\nHulling Columbia.\nHow gingerly they handled. those shin\n- Ing pieces of brass. Those unknown, silent,\ncrooked machines, with numberless pipes,\nvalves and slides. But as everything has\na beginning, so did this aggregation start\nIn to learn ihe uses of those instruments.\nThe first six months were devoted strict\nly to indoor practice. This was r.ecessary\nNot rtn.arkalily rapid progress was made\nbut after awhile, when some of the scales\nbad l>e- n mastered, the organization wa?\ngiven its first selection. It was \"Hail Co\nlumbio.\" It was some time before it was\ncon-id T. d a success. Tho itader was cer\ntainly earning his salary?he wasn't get\nting anything that year?and he thought it\ntime to take a stride forward. The strklu\nIras taken. The people hailed Columbia\n\"with oiK-n arms?a welcome relief after six\nmonths of scales?but th- y were just as\nready to v. elcome \"Home, Sweet Home,\"\nn hich follov ed.\nA change in the leadership seemed to\nIn! us\" new life into the members, anl\n??Yankee l>oodle.\" \"America.\" and one or\ntwo ?? isv \"marches\" followed in surprising\nrapidity.\nA band stand had been erected while th'\nTm-m!.fc-r>. were preparing to take the town\nl>y storm. but the summer passed, and it\nwas not occupied. In the fall a liock of\ntiirkev-, i re-emptied it. ar.d it was :iot until\nth. following spring that this gr< at com\nbination dared show itself in a whoiiy\npublic exhibition.\nI iiiform*. of Conrse.\nA uniform had been procured. Not a new\nene. for which each member had been\nmeasured. Nothing of the sort. It was\nSelected from a lot of fifty cast off by a\nmilitia i ompany duri-.g the war. The coats\nwere blue?and long?and buttoned down In\nfront t?i single-breasted style. There were\nHo trousers, hence the members were\nobliged to wear whatevtr they possessed.\nAnd* her a conflict of colors ensued. But\nth? m-mliers were clothed. They did not\nwear light. Jaunty caps. Here was where\nIhe defunct military got in its deadly work\nagain. The members of this band inherited\nIn arsklns?big bearskin bats, a foot or more\ntall, such as were seen in pictures repre\nsenting the battle of Bunker Hill.\nWell, the band progressed, gave a few\n?v.t-of-door concerts, serenaded the minis\nter and other village dignitaries, and re\nceived in invitation to head the procession\nMemorial day?\"Decoration u?y.\" No one\nsetmed to knowr In what order the band\nshould be made up?except the leader. He\n! knew, ar.d he lined the members up in the\nfcand room one evening.\nAnd such a line up! The l>asses wrere in\nth\" front rank. On the right was a tall.\nSoldierly man. six feet in height. He was\na model, but he was the only model In the\nyanks. His side partner, the one who\nJ-layed the second E-flat bass, was not over\nfive feet, hut what he lacked In height he\nir-ade up in circumference. Then came the\nman who played the G trombone?the only\ninstrument of the kind ever made. It was\na valve trombone, and extended about four\nfeet in front and In rear of the player, and\nIt* monstrous bell looked like the air pipes\nof an ocean liner.\nBut the player. He might have had a\nShape once. He hadn't then. Neither did\nlie have teeth, but his muscular develop\nment was immense. At times he would let\ngo a crash note that would set the win\ndows rattling in their casements, and\npiano pa-.- iges had no more effect on him\nthan so much water.\nHIk f? anal Trim,\nHe was the third man in the front rank.\nHi w:i stoop-shouldered, but his Dig bear\nskin was always upright, and if he ever\nStraightened?which he did occasionally by\naccident?the bearskin would cant off to\nthe north. at an angle of about 45 degrees.\nOther- wi re placed according to the Instru\nments p'.ayed, and after each had been as\nSigned a position, notice was given that on\na certain night the band would go out for\n?rili.\nIt did. Before that, however, it had elect\ned a iruirr major, and he carried a sword\nin place of a baton. The p|ace selected for\nthe drill was a level stretch of road on the\noutskirts of the village. The members were\ndue at 7 o'clock. They were there on time,\nand went through a series of straight\nmarching that was pleasing to the Instruc\ntor. Occasionally some one would step on\na loose stone and bump into his neighbor,\nskip a few notes, lose his place and say\nthings under his breath, but on the whole\nIt was pretty good work.\nAfter an hour of practice the drum ma\njor said: \"Now we will try a counter\nmarch When I about face and hold up\nmy swotd. the two right files turn to the\nriaht and march to the rear, and the two\n1 ft tiles turn to the left.\"\nThat sounded first-rate to hear it once.\ntint the execution of It was different. The\nband moved forward, playing a spirited\nmar<*h. when all at once the major whirl\ned about and threw up his sword. The\ntwo outside flies turned all right, but the\ntwo inside did the opposite. They had for\ngotten the combination. When the crash\ncame the four-foot extension of the big O\ntrombc lie struck the short, fat tuba player\nIn the .' olar plexus, while the latter un\nwittingly retaliated by hitting the nan\nWith the trombone squarely on the side of\nthe head. There was a sudden halt, and\n.the way those musicians came together\n?was an excellent Imitation of the march\nof the Amazons when rallying on the cen\nter.\nThe matter was adjusted.\nThe Horse Walls.\nThen came the memorable event In the\nhistory of that aggregation, a Memorial\nday. The procession, made up of veterans,\nfhildren lr carriages, fire department, town\ndignitaries and headed by the band, was\nto move at 10 o'clock. All hands were\nSromptly there, and each member of that\nand looked his prettiest.\nThe procession moved and the signal\ncame. \"Booni.\" \"boom.\" sounded the\ndrum, and the proud organization had be\ngun Its day's work.\nIn its preliminary practice no acoount\nhad been taken of horses that had never\nbeen Introduced to such music. Such a\nhorse was present when that band struck\nup \"No. 5 in the new book,\" and It began\na waits. In horse knowledge either *\nmarch or a waits would do. The drummer\nwas doing his best to puncture the air\nwith large chunks of calfskin music and\nsaw not the antics of the horse. At each\nblow the animal grew more restive. The\nleader saw the situation, and. Instead of\nsilencing the band, he signaled the drum\nmer. The latter was not on to the for\nmer's curves, and mistook the signal. In\nhis mind ho was saying, \"I'll be on deck\nwhen the procession gets under way,\" and,\ngripping his abnormal stick with the feroc\nity of a madman, he plied It with an In\ncreased violence.\nThe horse had decided to take a hand?\nor foot?and Just clearing the cymbal play\ner, who was adding brasen melody to the\ngeneral fund, the animal went among\nthose amateur musicians as does wind\nwhen It discerns a pile of feathers. It was\nthe first sad experience of that gaudy\ntroop, but, beyond that,* the exercises were\nwithout excitement, _\nDram t I Should Remark!\nThe ic? was broken by the event of Me\nmorial day. The members of that band\ngained In confidence as the novelty of the\nsituation wore off, and the fame of the\norganisation spread. It had out-of-town\nengagement*, held fairs, the proceeds of\nwhich went Into a new uniform fund:\nharder music was essayed, and even \"The\nBlue Danube\" waltz was found among Its\nselections. There were solos for cornets,\nfor the baritone, for the tenors, for every\nbody, and the supporters were pleased.\nIn the eyes of the small boy. however,\nthe snare drummer was the only mem\nber of that band. These ?ve-e they who\naspired not to tcot on horns of brass\nbut to drum. Had they not In secret,\nbattered the copper bottom of the old ram\nUy washboiler in their endeavor to master\nthe intricacies of the art of drumming.\nHad ihey not received a mighty inspira\ntion when following the veteran drummer\nat the head of the militia company on\ntraining davs?the veteran who had drum\nmed at Lundy's Lane? That veteran had\nbut recently passed away, and h:s mantle\nfell on no one. His successor, however, in\nthe opinion of those boys, was the drum\nmer in that country band, anij around him\nthey Hocked, even as hornets around the\nold gray nest In the appie tree.\nBut there came a time when the drum\nmer owned the town and all the inhabit\nants thereof, and even more did he be\ncome the envy of the small boy.\n(irralmt Solo oil Eurlii.\nIt was when the leader ordered a new\npiece. Its title was \"Drum Solo Quick\nstep.\" It was when the piece was given\ncut that the drummer's heart swelled with\npride. He took it home and studied it.\nKight measures rest for all the other in\nstruments. but a solo for him!\nOut back, of the barn ne went, and while\nthe neighbor's horses and cows stamped\na seeming applause, and the eggs 111 the\nnests of setting hens became addled be\ncause of the continually contused atmos\nphere. the drummer wot it not. He wres\ntled with that solo until he was sure of it.\nThen came the night of band rcom prac\ntice. The new piece was played for the\nfirst time, and when the eight measures\nrest came for the wind instruments there\nwas a sudden but brief calm. The drum\nmer, with all the assembled multitude\nlooking on. squared himself and cut loose.\nIt was a success. He didn't skip even so\nmuch as a hair's breadth of time In gel\nting to work?and he was happy.\nThe following Monday evening tlie new\npiece was.on the program?printed in the\nlocal paper?for the band stand playout.\nThe night came, thi piece c ime. the eight\nmeasures came. The one ?who was to do\nhis act. and all alone, was ready to catch\nthe beat on the instant, anil with the myr\niad small boy in attendance?who had\nalso read the program?he jumped to his\ntask. He gave that audience a selection\nnever before heard in drumming circles.\nHe gave excerpts from the five, seven and\nnine-stroke roils, the single and double\ndrag, two-four and s!x;elyht. the fiama\ndiddle and all other quick beats known to\nthe craft, and had he bee i given two\nmeasures more he wouid have given a\nspasm from the \"Dead Mar-h In Saul\"?\nplayed only on fu; oral occasions?so anx\nious was he to show his prowess.\nHe had his day, and was succeeded by\nother?equally good, and. possibly, bet'er?\ndrummers.\nIIOPIX'G IX GROOM AMI liltlDK.\nA Pollremnn Interfere* AYItli tin Old\nCheshire Wedding; Custom.\nFrom the Loodon News.\nOf the many marriage customs which still\nsurvive in many parts of rural England,\nthe one peculiar to the county of Cheshire,\nof roping a wedding party, is certainly in\nteresting. though it was the subject of\nmagisterial investigation at Sandbach petty\nsessions yesterday. Three men named\nDodd. Duckworth and Burrows were sum\nmoned for obstructing the highway at\nBechton, a village two miles from Sand\nbach. Last Saturday a rustic beauty was\nunited to her faithful swain at that vil\nlage, and the happy couple were driving\naway from the church, down Bechton Hill,\nwhen the observance of the marriage cus\ntom peculiar to the neighborhood brought\nthe carriage to a sudden stop. At the\nhorse's head stood Duckworth and Bur\nrows, holding the ends of a rope across the\nrrad. While the liberal display of rice and\nold shoes enables the friends of brides and\nbridegrooms elsewhere to speed the newly\nwedded couple. In Cheshire it seems to be\nthe custom to delay their departure till\nthey pay. their \"footing.\" The driver was\nat no loss, for It was part of the custom\nrot to proceed till those Inside had given\nthe rope bearers a shilling each. Another\nvillager named Dodd saw no reason for his\nexclusion from the benefits of the custom,\nsince, after Duckworth and Burrows had\nreceived the coin, he promptly fixed up an\nother wedding rope across the highway.\nOnce more had the wedding carriage to\nstop, and the funds of the couple to defray\nthe expenses of the honeymoon were the\npoorer by another shilling, l.'nfortunately,\nhowever, a police offi^r. who happened to\nhe driving In the neighborhood, was a high\nly interested spectator of the proceedings.\nHe caused Duckworth. Burrows and Dodd\nto bo summoned, and they were lined, the\ntwo first named half a crown each ancl\nDodd five shillings.\nAt'i'flrrfry Curried Too Far.\nFrom the Glasgow Weekly Mail.\nA ship once went on a cruise, and the\ncaptain determined to keep an accurate\naccount of the voyage In his logbook. Ont'\nmorning the first mate, who had been\non a lark the day before, looking over the\nlogbook, found this entry: \"The first mat#\nwas drunk all day yesterday.\"\nHe at once appealed to the captain, ray\ning to him: \"Why In the world did you\nwant to write that In the logbook?\"\n\"Is It not true?\" questioned the captain.\n\"Yes, but there was no use to state it.\"\n\"Oh. yes, there was. I Intend to keep a\nfull and accurate record of what goes on\non board this ship during the entire voy\nage.\"\nTho first mate was compelled to submit,\nbut his turn came. Next day he was In\ncharge of the ship, the captain taking off a\nday.\nWhen he turned up the next morning, he\nfound written on the logbook: \"The cap\ntain was sober all day yesterday.\" Of\ncourse, he entered a protest.\n'Well, weren't you sober all day?\" asked\nthe mate.\n\"Of course, but there was no use of stat\ning It.\"\n\"Oil, yes. I was merely carrying out\nyour instructions and keeping an accurate\nrecord of what occurred on board.\"\nCklrxo Library I uiforma.\nFrom the Chicago Post.\nTo adopt a costume of cadet gray, to be\nworn all days, whether becoming or un\nbecoming, Is a dismal fate for the women\nemployed in the public library. Cadet\ngray, though a pretty color. Is unsuitable\nto many complexions, which will consti\ntute a serious objection against the Inno\nvation. And it never was Intended that a\nwoman should confine herself to one shade\nor hue in her gowns; the monotony of it\nproduces effects not to be classed as im\naginary. There are psychological reasons\nwhy a uniform is objectionable If the aes\nthetic ones are not sufficient to convince\nthose who have passed the arbitrary meas\nure. To be sure, birds and leopards can't\nchange their features and spots, and still\nthey manage to thrive but every woman\nknows the instantaneous and desirable ef\nfect on the mind many times when a dif\nferent frock Is substituted for one that\nhas crown all too familiar. A color soon\nbecomes distasteful If worn constantly, es\npecially without a dash of something else\nto relieve It.\nCURRENT S-LANGUAGE\nHow Oar Vernacular Grows by Accre\ntion.\nThe Person Who Cki Sing Finds\nGood Lugnace Tame and Feeble\nHe Is Like am Old Toper.\nEllen Burns In the Critic.\nThe Italian method of prefixing; an s to\na word to give It a damaging significance\ncan be employed with good effect in chris\ntening that wayward and degenerate off\nspring of English known as slang.

It over\nlooks the famous battlefield of Stone river,\nand suggests comfort, rest and meditation.\n1 was struck with the solitude of the place\n?away from the noise of the pikes and the\nwhirr of the town, and the observation of\nneighbors.\nAfter sweeping for miles around the most\nfertile plain ln the state, the eye rests upon\nthe blue surrounding mountains, not, how\never. so picturesque as those of east Ten\nnessee, whose peculiar people and lofty\npeaks so suddenly lifted Miss Murfree into\nfame; to be the George Eliot of America.\nM1s3 Murfree is about thirty-five, with a\nlarge, strong, yet sweet and kindly face,\nthat glows into beauty when animated in\nconversation. In' figure she is low and\nstout. Her voice is deep for a woman, but\npleasing to the ear, and her style of con\nversation Is quite deliberate, and, of course,\nelegant. She is a delightful listener', and is\nalways willing for others to lead ln con\nversation, possibly for the reason her sister\ncan do It so well if others do not make the\nattempt. She has that modest, stately bear\ning that is a distinguishing type of our\nsouthern ante-bellum aristocracy. In gen\neral conversation she tries in a delicate\nway to prevent the 'drift of thought from\nflowing toward her and her works. Miss\nMurfree's gfnlus has been faithfully nur\ntured by a mother who in some respects is\nalmost as remarkable as her daughter. Al\nthough eighty-one years of age, she keeps\nup her music. While I was there she, with\nremarkable skill and technique, rendered\ntwo of Mend ilssohn's most famous minors.\nIn speaking of her mother's tuition. Miss\nMurfree said: \"Mother was determined to\nteach us three things thoroughly; The\nmajor and minor scales, the multiplication\ntable and to speak the truth.\" \"The Jug\ngler,\" Miss Murfree's last Vork, she thinks\nis her best.

One day Ralph Parsons cut a\ncottonwood goad and drove his ox team\nhome, aided by its inspiring touch. One of\nthe Parsons girls stuck the goad into the\nground.

In the third\nact of the play he had a projwsal rcene\nwith a young woman for whom he felt\nsomething more than a passing regard.\nThe lines of the proposal sceno were full\nof music and pafslon. It was agreed that\nthe young man spoke them remarkably\nwell. In fact, at least one hundred people\ntold him he ought to give up his present\nvocation (living with his father) and go on\nthe \"real stage.\"\nThe girl was seated on .1 sofa, sighing\nover a bouquet of flowers he had sent her,\nwhen he entered L. IT. E.. came down the\nstage a few steps, hesitated, and then\nwalked resolutely toward the sofn. and Ve\ngan. standing behind the girl. The stage\nlover usually stands behind the obji-ct of\nhis regard and pours his appeal over her\nleft shoulder:\nHe?\"Dora!\"\nShe?\"Oh, Mr. Valentine, how you star\ntled me!\"\nHe (aside)?\"My flowers!\"\nShe?\"I was thinking of you just now.''\nHe?\"Thinking of me?\"\nShe?\"Thinking of \"\nHe?\"Yes.\"\nShe?\"I mean-that I was admiring these\nflowers you sent me.

You re\nmember?\"\nShe (plucking a rose to pieces)?\"Yes.\"\nHe?\"Then came the cruel separation.

To tell the\ntruth, however, he inaile a different sort of\nan effort when he actually proposed to the\ngirl who had played l>ora.

The use of the wheel is In its\ninfancy In Russia, It seems, the climate\nbeing unfavorable in the northern part dur\ning a great part of the year. Only In the\nsummer months is It possible to ride at Ml.\nYet in St. Petersburg there are already\nfour cycling clubs, besides three in the sub\nurbs. Up to February 1. 1807, ladies were\nnot permitted to ride a bicycle In the sreets\nof St. Petersburg, but they now have that\nliberty. As to the \"makes\" In use, English\nand German predominate, the former re\ntailing at from $82 to U28. the latter at\nfrom 177 to $92. The Singer company and\nthe Humber company?both branches of\nEnglish companies?have works in Russia,\nthe one at Warsaw, the other at Moscow.\nThere are, besides, three Russian factories\nand many shops which put together and\nfinish the parts of wheels Importod from\nEngland and Germany. But two American\nwheels were imported last year, the cost\nbeing excessive for the average Russian.\nTh<Ftarift on Imported wheels Is $0.20, and\n10,ti09 were Imported In 1806.\nAmerican riders, who enjoy the maxi\nmum of liberty?not to say license?In the\nuse of the wheel, as In other things, can\nnot but be Interested in the regulations a\npaternal government enforces for the pre\nvention of accidents. Some of them will\nappear to be unduly vexatious, but not a'\nfew are In the public Interest and deserve\nthe attention of our authorities. To begin\nwith, a permit Is required before one may\nride at all in St. Petersburg. To get this\npermit from the municipal authority the\nwould-be wheelman must first pass on ex\naminatii i on the wheel before one of the\ncycling associations of the city. On pro viae\nhi* proficiency he obtains a certificate. and,\narmed with thta Mid a photograph of him\nself. he applies for his permit and for a\nbooklet containing the city's rules and reg\nulations for cyclists, the whole costing him,\nwith the revenue stamp, tl.lS. This per\nmit, which bears the name of the owner\nof the wheel. Is good for one year. The\nphotograph must be af.tohed to the per\nmit, and both wheel and rider have a regis\ntered number. Oreat Importance Is attach\ned to the identity of the rider, so that his\nmisdeeds. If any. may be easily brought\nhome to htm. \"The number.\" says the re\nport, \"In plain white figures on a reil plate,\nmust be fastened to the wheel, both on the\nfront and hack, so as to be clearly visible\nto the police and the public in case of any\nmishap or disobedience of the prescrll>ed\nregulations for bicycle riders. One plate,\nwith the numbers on both sides, is fastened\nto the frame In front, below Ihe handle\nbar, sticking out so that the number can\nbe seen from either side, and one plate Is\nfastened to the frame behind, below the\nsaddle, in such a way as to be In full view\nwhen the person is sitting on (he saddle.\"\nThe regulations are of Interest for the ex\ntreme care they tr.ke to curb the reckless\n\"scorcher\" and make the city's streets safe\nfor persons not on wheels. They are as\nfollows;\n\"Bicycle riding In the streets of the city\nIs allowed only on low. two-wheeled bi\ncycles or on bicycles of other types which\nare considered by the city administration\nnot dangerous Only tho*e persons of\nproper age. who have received a permit\nfrom the St. Petersburg city administra\ntion, can ride. The permit must bear the\nname of the proprietor and Is given only to\npersons who know how to ride a bicycle.\nBy the city governor's special order the\nperson who receives a permit to H.ie a bi\ncycle must give a photograph of himself,\nwhich is attached'to the permit.\n\"Every person who has received a permit\nto ride a bicycle in the city Is gii|>plied by\nthe city administration with a number. He\nmust have on his bicycle a bell and after\ndark a lighted lantern. The kind of tag.\nthe time and way in which it must be at\ntached to the bicycle are established by the\ncity administration and confirmed by the\ncity governor.\n\"Each person riding a bicycle must carry\nwith him the permit, with the pre?ont reg\nulations printed on It. Fast riding or rac\ning in the city is not allowed. Biders must\nalways keep to the right, as near to the\nsidewalk as possible. Riders must pass\nfoot passengers and equipage* on the left\nhand side, if possible. In overtaking a foot\npassenger or an equipage, the bicycle rider\nmust in due time ring the bell and he must\npass slowly. To ring without need is pro\nhibited. No other signals except bells are\nallowed. In case horses should take fright\nat a bicycle, the rider must stop and alight.\n\"In turning a corner or In crossing a\nstreet the bicycle must be ridden very slow\nly and the bell rung. In localities where\nthere is much public traffic and many\nequipages riders must alight and lead their\nwheels. When several bicycle riders are to\ngether they must ride, one after the other,\n[ at a distance not less than fourteen feet\nbetween each bicyplo. It Is prohibited to\nride or lead a bicycle on sidewalks, roads\nfor pedestrians, boulevards, squares and\nI parks. Biling a bicycle In the city In a\n| racing costume, without a coat, or in such\ncostume as would attract special attention.\nIs prohibited: The riding of bicycles Ml be\nstopped on some streets by order of the\npolice in the following cases: During the\nj time when their imperial majesties are ex\n| pected to pass; during religious processions\nand in places where there is a large gaiher\nj ing of people and equipages. The riding of\nbicycles is not allowed on certain parks\nof the NevskI Prospect nor In Summer\nPark. The city governor has the right to\nprohibit the riding of bicycles in some of\nthe streets of the city. A person violating\nthese regulations may lie deprive.! by the\npolice of his permit; he may also be brought\nby the police before the court.\"\nOffice Drum nine**.\nFrom Tid-Itlts.\n\"Some men are quite martyrs to office\ndrowsiness,\" a physician remarked the\nother day. \"Any monotonous sound near\nthem, the hum of traffic outside, or even\nthe scratching of a clerk's pen Is sufficient\nto induce a feeling of sleepiness which it is\nalmost impossible to resist.\n\"The worst of it is that this symptom U\nso seldom regarded as anything serious,\nthough I have known it to be the beginning\nof critical mental trouble. Far more often,\nhowever. It is merely the effect of constitu\ntional eccentricity, though in either case a\nfew simple remedies might be tried with\nadvantage.\n\"For instance. I always advise the old in\ndigestion cure?a glass of ho; water?when\nthe feeling comes on. To keep the eyes\ntightly closed for three or four minutes and\nthen bathe them in very warm water oft? n\ngives relief at once. And another good Idea\nis to lower the head for a few seconds to a\nlevel with the knees. Above all. one should\nnever give in to the feeling of drowsiness\nby taking a short nap in the hope of wak\ning up brighter after it.\n\"At the same time the condition of the\noffice might be looked to. The slightest\ndefect in ventilation will often cause one\nman to be affected by office drowsiness,\neven though other people In the same room\nfeel nothing of it whatever.\"\nThe Minister Who Witi an Elk.\nFrom the New York Trlhiine.\n\"An Episcopal clergyman of Grand Rap\nids. Mich., who belongs to the order of the\nElks,\" says a member of that order, \"at\ntended a meeting the other evening. The\nchairman, noticing his presence, said: 'I\nsee our Rev. Brother among us this\nevening. As this is such an unusual oc\ncurrence, I think he will have to be as\nsessed $5.' The rector put his hand Into\nhis waistcoat pocket, and, marching up to\nthe desk, put down his little V, and made\na nice little speech in which he told how\nglad he was to be with his brother Elks,\nand ended by inviting them to come and\nhear him preach the next Sunday evening.\nSome one moved that the Eiks accept the\ninvitation and go in a body to their broth\ner's church, which was unanimously car\nried. The next Sunday evening the front\npews of the church were filled with Elks,\nand when Rev. Mr. ascended his pul\npit, he said: 'I am delighted to see so many\nof my brother Elks here this evening, but\nas it is such an unusual occurrence with\nthe most of them, I think they should each\nbe assesssed $1. Let your ll&ht so shine,\nctc.' The way the silver dollars rattled oil\nthat plate was a caution. The contribution\nwas much heavier than usual, and the Elks\nvoted their reverend brother all right.\"\nm\nArchneology and the Illblc.\nFrof. Sayre la the llotniletlc Review.\nOriental archaeology affords us a test and\na measure for Old Testament history; It is\nnot a substitute for it. There are large\nportions of Old Testament history which\ncan only be illustrated by archaeological\nresearch not covered by It; portions which\nfrom the necessity of the case do not ad\nmit of monumental confirmation. The\nscenes of home life in the liistory of the\nPatriarchs, for example, can never be the\nsubject of an Inscription; all the archaeolo\ngists can do is to illustrate them from the\nlife of other orientals, and '.o show that\nthey contain nothing which is Inconsistent\nwith either history or geography. So,\nagain, the wanderings of the Israelites In\nthe desert are not likely to be recorded on\nthe monuments of the past. But it can be\nshewn that these wanderings are the\nnecessary Interlude between the exodus\nfrom Egypt and the conquest of Canaan,\nand that for both the latter events there is\nsufficient archaeological testimony. Arch\naeology Is the handmaid of the Bible, not\nits substitute.\nA Prompt Boy.\nFrom Tid-Bits.\nSmall boy dashed breathless Into a mer\nchant's office.\n\"Is the guv'nor in?\"\n\"Yes; what do you want?\"\n\"Must see hini myself; most partlkler.\"\n\"But you can't; he's engagtd.\"\n\"Must see him lmmejit; most partlkler.\"\nThe boy's importunity got him In.\n\"Well, boy; what do you want?\"\n\"D*yer wan: a orfflce boy, sir?\"\n\"You Impudent young rascal!

Robert J. seems to be the\nsteadier of the two. He seemed to go\neasily within himself from start to llnlsh\nyesterday, while Gentry appeared fidgetjr\nat the start, and again In the last 1<*?\nyards from the flinch. The performance\nunquestionably demonstrates that, while\nGentry has the fastest mark by a second.\nRobert J. has the stoutest heart, and If It\ncomes to a ques'lon of grit In demolishing\nrecords by this pair In the future It will\nnot be the latter who will falter.

The first quarter was reached\nIn .33 and the half In l.<MVs?a i?.iK> gait. It\nwas Bowne's Intention to urge his horses\nfrom now on to the finish, but after going\nhalf a furlong further Gentry slipped his\nboot, and then he had to ease up going\naround the upper turn; still he rea. hed the\nthree-quarter post in 1.37. It was not until\nBowne had gotten around the long turn\nand reached the stretch that he let the two\nflyers straighten out their necks and that\nhe began to urge them. Considerable val\nuable time was lost In getting around this\nturn, but after reaching the stretch the\ntwo pacers let themselves out and came fly\ning to tho wire. It was a close race against\ntime, and everybody felt they would get\nthere ahead of the record If neither horse\nbroke. All eyes were on Gentry, who once\nor twice swerved as if ready to Jump up.\nbut Bowne had him well in hand and thori\nwas great applause as the pair shot under\nthe wire.\nA thousand or more watches had taken\nthe time, end all agreed that the record\nhad been broken.

We thus find to what relative\ner, and so similar, that they must have sprung trom\none common source, and must have been trans\nmitted from one to another. The fact that be\ntween the Latin and French, and between the\nLatin and Italian especially, there is the closest\nresemblance that the Romanic is similar to the\nGermanic that. Greek and Sanscrit or these di\nalects known as the Indo-Germauic have, it is\nclaimed, so to speak, the same vocabulary that\ntheir roots can be traced to the same forms these\nfacts have been considered evidence of a transmis\nsion of language from one tribe to another, and\nthat all speaking t'uem were related by common\ndescent, and had received them by direct tradition\nfrom these earlier common sources.\nThis I deny directly.\n. The inference is entirely unfounded ; these re\nsemblances do not show the samo origir. still less\nthat they - have been derived by tradition. Even\nfrom researches in the animal kingdom, this posi\ntion is shown to be false.' Language is to man as\nvoice to.' auimals. To each kind there is a distinct\nclass ef sounds, characteristic of the species. As\nfor instance, birds wild and tame have a set of\nsonnds peculiar to themselves, and unlike all other\n. animals. ; Again, the mockiug bird has its charac\nteristic voice, as all thrushes have a similar voice\nwhich distinguishes them. But the voice of a dog\nis utdike that of a tiger the dog kind all bark,\nwhile the cat kind all have a kind of mewing cry.\nSome kinds may indeed mock others, as the\nmocking-bird imitates others' notes. They have,\nhowever, each a peculiar and characteristic note ;\nso the negro in speaking English, French or Span-\n. ish, when he has learned them, does not give their\nidiomatic accent, he utters them as his throat and\nnature have modified them.\n, There is a marked diversity between different\nspecies of animals iu this respect. . We have for\ninstance many species of the dog-family, as wolves,\nfoxes, jackalU, the blue fox of the artic regions ;\nbesides distinct species in Asia, Africa, and South\nA . \" 1 .1 V m\nivmenca, out tney ou oarfc. lueir cries are as\ncharacteristic as their instincts. They all hunt,\nchase, rollow their prey to death, and these mttm\nsic peculiarities are universally, distinctive of the\ntamuy.\n' Again of the cat kind, we have the lion, the\ntiger, the red tiger, the puma, the wild cats, and\nmany other species, m all no less than thirty-six,\nof different sizes, and many specific unlikenesses :\nbut their, general characteristics are the same ; their\nur.ity is as intimate as that of dogs. They all,\n... me tiger, lion, &c, like cats, await their prey, and\nfailing to catch it by springing, do not pursue it\njj&euogs,\nThey are alike treacherous, and all mew. ' The\nroar of the lion, and the cry of the cat, if philo-\n.Hopnicairy analyzed, might show as great Similarity\nas tne oreefc and Sanscrit. And yet the mode o:\narticulation is the same in the lion and tiger.\nSo of birds.

So the thrushes are easily known\nby their sweet song., And though they mock the\nsongs \"of other birds, we yet recegoizt them by\ntheir proper voice. There are many different spe\nJ cies of these : there being no less than 6 here, 8\ny or 9 in Europe, also other varieties in Africa and\n, Asia, yet their song is as like as that of the wood\npecker a.

Ihe admission of\nany idea of transmission from other kinds, would\nbe to overthrow Physiology and Comparative An\nanomy altogether. The conclusion is perfectly\ngratuitous. There is not a particle of evidence to\nsustain such a gradation in a single instance.\nThe end towards which all these modifications of\nthe material and animal world tends, is man.\nWhile there is a complete separation between dif\nferent species of living beings, they have all reached\ntheir highest devclupmcnt in the present order of\nthings. The whole process has led to this result\nthroughout, there has been the simultaneous exist\nence of these classes, evidently planned from the\nbeginning . for this end; arranged so as to find\ntheir full expression and highest type iu man.\nThe question arises whether there will be further\nprogress whether there will be another creation\nand an order of brings higher than man. In an\nimal structures, on the present plan, there seems no\nroom tor turiner progress, it we examine the\nstructure of the vertebrates, we sec that fishes have\nthe back in a horizontal position that the brain\nis a mere prolongation of the spinal marrow that\ntheir structure confines them to a horizontal posi\ntion, which they also keep while iu rodtiou. In\nreptiles we find another structure ; the anterior\nlobe of the brain is small, the middle larger. In\nbirds the middle lobe advances so as partly to cov\ner the posterior lobe. In man the hindmost lobe\nis covered by the middle one, and that by the an\nterior lobe. The spine is vertical, giving an erect\nposition. Thus we see that in him the anterior\nlobe of the brain is most prominent, and hence\nespecially of use ; as we see from their plan that\nbirds are adapted for moving freely in the air, so\nfar there is a gradation there is no farther room\nfor enlarging ou this plan. From fishes up to man\nwe have evidences of a plan, made with reference\nto his introduction and superiority.\nFrom these views wo should learn the great re\nsponsibilities that belong to us as the Lead of cre\nation, and also the value and importance of these\nstudies.\nNations made up of mingled elements are a peculiar jboniferous, the Cretaceous, tc, each of which\nmodern history.
