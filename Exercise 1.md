# Exercise 1

The [annotation](https://hyp.is/EJGWbFYHEeiFfD8om_WIGA/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/) I found was in the Sunrise on Methodology and Radical Transparency of Sources in Historical Writing. I found this comment to be interesting since it really expands on the idea of transparency and what it can do for readers. The idea of giving people direct access to primary sources is a pretty big game changer and it makes me reflect on great modalities of this such as Wikipedia, whom I think are notorious for trying to source information that is being referenced. Opening up how things are found can truly lead to a huge exploration of ideas and concepts. This is also something I find incredibly prevalent in Wikipedia but you can deep dive into a topic, find a link and just go on a huge journey of concepts and ideas; you may start on an article of cats but find yourself reading into black holes simply due to the vast linkage network present. I hope that historians can link their ideas and sources in a similar manner where you can find related works and ideas simply due to transparency and an overarching system that can be crosslinked across many different works.
